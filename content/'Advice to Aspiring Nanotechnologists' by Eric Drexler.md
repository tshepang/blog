The great Eric Drexler offers [extensive guidance] for those considering
studying towards molecular nanotech, and that quote is most relevant to
me, since I'm doing software and all.

The end-notes, where he encourages supreme rigour and discipline, would
scare most away. This appears to be a demanding career.
