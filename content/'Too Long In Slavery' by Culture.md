The mood of [Too Long In Slavery] (performed by [Culture] and found in
*Greatest Hits - The Frontlne Years*) matches it's title pretty well
(the vocalist sounds like he's in pain and so is the melody). The track
still sounds is near-playful, though it has nearly brought me to tears
on a few occasions; it's a powerful delivery of a painful message.
It's my favorite among the group's work.
