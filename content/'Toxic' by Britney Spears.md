I had developed a negative attitude towards Britney Spear\'s music due
bad quality (though to be fair, I haven\'t listened to much of her work,
all but the most popular few tracks). But there is one particular gem,
*Toxic*, and I was surprised to find that [it\'s critically acclaimed],
especially since I reduced it to a guilty pleasure.
