There's no better movie director in my mind than David Fincher, an
honor granted due to his work in the excellent [Se7en] and the
masterpiece, [Fight Club] . He has made 4 other movies, most impressive
of which is *The Game*. *Zodiac*, his latest, has among the most complex
*storylines* in movie experience and I leave it unrated for I don't
know what I can say about it, other than that I expected it to have been
treated with stylistic flair (as was the case with *Fight Club* and
*Panic Room*), but Fincher decided to refrain.

One notable thing is Mark Ruffalo's lead detective, the movie's best
performance. It's the kind of performance (vocal and physical) I've
never seen before.
