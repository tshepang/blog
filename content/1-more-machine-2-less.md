Since I've departed from previous job, I've lost access to [two
machines], but more than made up for it by acquiring an Acer Travelmate
6592, a feature-rich laptop complete with wireless connectivity
(802.11a/b/g), Bluetooth, card readers, fingerprint scanner, webcam,
Firewire, and even age-old DB9 serial port, while also not being short
on specs (Intel T7500 processor, 2GB DDR2, 250GB HDD). Even better,
unlike those two machines, I also get to take it home.
