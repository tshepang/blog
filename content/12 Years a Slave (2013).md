I expected a lot more, and got disappointed by the less-than-impressive
direction and script. Not even Chiwetel Ejiofor saves it, and he in fact
exposes his limitations as an actor, which is sad given I am something
of a fan... see him in [Redbelt] and *Four Brothers* for example.

The one interesting subplot is one involving the sex pet, whose fate is
less than desirable. Not that her performance is any excellent, nor her
scenes particularly well-made. She just happens to be in a rather unique
situation, and I like her face :)

This may end up the most overrated movie of the year. There's not much
value in here. Find something else. If in a mood for some Black American
slavery stuff, check out the far superior [Mandingo] and [Goodbye Uncle
Tom], or even [Django Unchained].
