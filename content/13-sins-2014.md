A brilliant concept, clearly inspired by *The Game* thriller and *Saw*
series of horror movies. I am a fan of Ron Perlman, so long as he's not
given shit roles like in [Pacific Rim]. He does great work here, him and
[Rutina Wesley]. The 'happy' ending thing is also stupid. The voice
acting of the evil guy on the phone is wonderful, and so is his script.
What a pleasure!

Story concepts this good seldom have great conclusions, and this one is
no exception. The twist is just not needed at all (it's too much of a
stretch, both the father and brother thing). It would have also been
nice to have more of a reveal of the villains.
