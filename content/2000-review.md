The __best performance__ is that of Maggie Cheung in _In the Mood for Love_
(perfectly exquisite, and even understated/reserved),
while my __favorite performance__ is that of Marlon Wayans in _Requiem for a Dream_.
It's the only respectable role I've seen of his,
and he is beautiful.

The __best theme song__ is that of _In the Mood for Love_... [enjoy].
