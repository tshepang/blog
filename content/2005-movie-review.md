The highly entertaining [Kung Fu Hustle] is **movie of the year**. The
**runner-up**, the surreal [The Triplets of Belleville], portrays rich
human emotion (boredom and pain in this case), perhaps reaching levels
impossible with live action.

**best movie of the year** - *City of God*

Top-notch film-making skill deserving of a masterpiece; same goes for
camerawork and editing. All this makes for an exhilarating ride through
the unbelievably violent streets of Mexico City's slums. It's the kind
of movie which reminds me of a *Pulp Fiction* while remaining very
different, except for a seeming fact that both directors relish in the
violence.

**performance of the year**

Li'l ZÃ©, the incredibly vicious villain in *City of God*. The runner-up
is Morgan Freeman's performance (his best so far) of a loser and
old-time boxer in *Million Dollar Baby* which ties with Kevin Spacey's
political activist in a superior [The Life of David Gale]. A lesser, but
favorite, performance of mine is that of Laurence Fishburne in *Mystic
River*, proving that he shouldn't be in bad money vehicles like the two
sequels of *The Matrix*.

**spectacle of the year** - *The Island*

Great visuals and an intriguing story-line help make this the year's
greatest spectacle. The runner-up happens to be *King Kong* for nobody
has captured them ritualistic humans so perfectly as Peter Jackson did
here nor did anyone ever commit such superb visual effects to screen.
That's some explosive shit, and I only wish the plausibility of the
story was given some thought. An honorable mention under this category
is *The House of Flying Daggers* for, even if didn't like the love
triangle non-sense, I haven't seen film battles quite captured like
this before. Harks back to a greater *Hero* which shared the same
director, Zhang Yimou. Another honorable mention goes to *The
Incredibles* which happened to be the most impressive of all 3D animated
films so far, and also blessed with a wonderful and fresh script.
