The highly entertaining [Kung Fu Hustle] is **movie of the year**. The
**runner-up**, the surreal [The Triplets of Belleville], portrays rich
human emotion (boredom and pain in this case), perhaps reaching levels
impossible with live action.

**performance of the year**

Morgan Freeman's performance (his best so far) of a loser and
old-time boxer in *Million Dollar Baby* is unbeatable. A lesser, but
favorite, performance of mine is that of Laurence Fishburne in *Mystic
River*, proving that he shouldn't be in bad money vehicles like the two
sequels of *The Matrix*.

**spectacle of the year** - *King Kong*

Nobody
has captured them ritualistic humans so perfectly as Peter Jackson did
here nor did anyone ever commit such superb visual effects to screen.
That's some explosive shit, and I only wish the plausibility of the
story was given some thought. An honorable mention under this category
is *The House of Flying Daggers* for, even if didn't like the love
triangle non-sense, I haven't seen film battles quite captured like
this before. Harks back to a greater *Hero* which shared the same
director, Zhang Yimou. Another honorable mention goes to *The
Incredibles* which happened to be the most impressive of all 3D animated
films so far, and also blessed with a wonderful and fresh script.
