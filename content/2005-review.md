My **favorite performance** is by Cuba Gooding Jr. in *[Shadowboxer]*.
The following are great runner-ups,
even though they have a far more limited time onscreen:

- [Torry Kittles] in *Dirty*
- [Nate Parker] also in *Dirty*

My favorite **non-human characters** is the Vogons in
*The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy*.
I love the humor they represent:
their looks, their movement, and their love for poetry.
