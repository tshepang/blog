## movie of the year

*Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* for its visual splendour
and excitement. The runner-up in this category is [Shaolin Soccer],
which is made by the same guy who made 2005's movie of the year, [Kung
Fu Hustle].

## best movie

The year's best movie is [Birth],
and there is stiff competition coming from the exciting and superb
*Confessions of A Dangerous Mind* as well as [Lord of War]. Such a
listing convinces me that, although the year wasn't as exciting, it
probably had more supreme movies compared to [2005].

## spectacle of the year

Nothing beats *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* in terms of
size, not to mention breath-taking effects.

## performance of the year

Crispin Glover shines in a bizarre performance in the surreal [Dead
Man], however the year's favorite is easily Eamonn Walker's
dictator in [Lord of War], a great highlight of an already brilliant
movie. I found the character portrayal of Tia Dalma, the witch in *Dead
Man's Chest*, the closest competitor to Eamonn Walker's character.

## best female performance

Nicole Kidman's perplexed widow in [Birth] is her most intense and best
ever.

## best male performance

Jack Nicholson steals the screen away from the two leads of *Easy
Rider*, while John Malkovich is notable for *Ripley's Game*. Another
impressive, but overly self-conscious performance, is that for the
daring show host found in *V for Vendetta*.

## best cast

*Red Dragon* wins in this category due to luminous appearances from the
likes of Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Emily Watson, etc.

## direction

George Clooney really outdoes himself (even considering this is a debut)
in the beautifully-crafted *Confessions of A Dangerous Mind*. This is
not nearly the genius that is shown in Darren Aronofsky's [Pi], and
only masters wind up making electrifying fables like *A History of
Violence*.

## beautiful imagery

The festival depicted in *Ghost in the Shell 2* is breathtaking.
Runner-up is *Rize*'s well-sculpted climactic scene, the one in which
the performers dance to the sun with oil-covered skin, is so illustrious
the characters seem god-like.

## irritating, disturbing

*Life Aquatic* takes the lead here.

## action movie

Me not being comfortable about the fact that there weren't too many
competitors, *Assault on Precinct 13* still deserves attention for its
action (though it's no *Die Hard*) and good direction, even though
it's got nothing fresh.

## scariest

[Birth] wins for its edge-of-the-seat, slow thrills, well-enhanced by
its performances, owed to Nicole and the boy.

## script

[Lord of War] deserves this one for its very fresh take on gun-running,
which happened to be a foreign idea to me.

## character design

The gorgeous designs in *A Corpse Bride* are breathtaking, but this only
applies to living humans and not the ghosts, which are too gimmicky for
my liking.

## strangest movie

This honor goes to the weird [Dead Man] which has some very memorable
scenes; It also has the honor of being totally respected by
master-critic, Jonathan Rosenbaum.

## cinematography

*Man on Fire*, with excellent, grainy touches and handheld camerawork,
is followed by *Delicatessen*'s
ultra-polished images and, to a lesser extent, *Tsotsi*'s shots of
SA's less pleasant living conditions.

## music

*Tsotsi*'s energetic Kwaito beats are well-executed, enhancing the
movie.

## war movie

*Tears of the Sun* shows the tough realities of African guerilla
warfare, distorted as it may be.

## production design

Tough competition sees *Man on Fire*, *Spiderman 2*, and
*Tsotsi* battling without a clear winner.

## visual effects

*Pirates of the Caribbean* is up there with *King Kong* among the
greatest ever visual spectacles. An honorable mention goes to *SpiderMan
2*.

## sound

*The Ring* uses wonderful sound to achieve its scare effort and is
followed closely by *Man on Fire*.

## editing

Nothing beats *The Ring* here especially with the well-done flashbacks.
Runner-up is *Man on Fire*.

## voice talent and voice-overs

One could watch *Sin City* just for the tough guy, deep male voices
heard throughout.

## shit

*Star Wars III* has the worst editing, worst acting, worst sound, worst
direction, but got beaten by *Eurotrip* as worst movie.
