The **best movie** is [Smokin' Aces] for its exciting action, excellent
direction, and appealing story concept.

My **favorite performances** is by Taraji Henson who plays an exciting,
yet heartbreaking, role of a feminist sniper in [Smokin' Aces].
Runner-up is that of Frances McDormand in [Friends with
Money].
