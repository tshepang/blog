Not such a good year at the movies if compared to [2005] and [2006], and
there's isn't even a single masterpiece.

## movie of the year

Nothing this year has had as much impact on me as has Mel Gibson's
[Apocalypto] given its gruelling tale of cruelty, the sort I never
witnessed before.

## enchanting

*Polar Express* was made a number of years ago but it still packs a
punch in many of its moments especially the near-accident of the magic
train, the dance sequence of chocolate presentation, and the North pole
environment. These are possibly the most magical ever sequences in movie
history. *Ratatouille*, another fantasy, is a very enjoyable runner-up,
even given its formulaic touches, typical of so much animation out
there.

## cinematography

[Munich] can't be beaten in this category for its flawlessly-polished
look. It is followed by a much smaller movie, *Three Colours Blue*, for
its beautiful usage of lighting.

## production design

It's rare that an old movie would impress this much due to its visual
aspects, but the design of the alien environment in *Alien* was
breath-taking. The runner-up happened to be *District B13* for its
rotting and crime-ridden urban setting.

## cast

What helped make [Apocalypto] feel so real is its cast of unknowns; I
did not notice any misplacement or annoying performance. The runner-up
is the cast of *American Gangster* (and that does not include the two
leads). *Hot Fuzz* wins the title for comic cast.

## performances

The __best female performance__ is that of Anne Parillaud,
who plays the lead in *Sex is Comedy*, portraying a tough yet lovely
movie director. The performance is enhanced very well by her limp.
The __best male performances__ is Forest Whitaker in [The Last King of Scotland].
Mark Ruffalo's subdued but highly-focused
character in *Zodiac* is runner-up.

## characters

The best **villain** is Josh Brolin's dirty cop found in *American Gangster*
for its unflinching acts of corruption, while the most **exotic** character is Angelina
Jolie's demon in [Beowulf]. The most __desirable gal__ is tie between
Vera Farmica of *The Departed*, Ana Claudia Talancon'
in *El Crimen del Padro Amaro*, and Kerry Washington in [The Last King
of Scotland] are tied as runner-ups. Julianne Moore in *Next* is the
year's best **detective** given her unrelenting focus in getting the job
done. A special mention should go to John Heder's goofy and
kind-hearted ice skating champion in the delightful *Blades of Glory*.
The best **character design** is the child-killing monster in
[Pan's Labyrinth].

## visuals

The year's greatest spectacle, *Transformers*, is also the year's best
visual effects showcase, and should have tied with the runner-up,
*Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End*, had it not been so
exciting. That runner-up would have won had it come up with something
more interesting than the stormy battle. *The Number 23* wins the year's
best imagery/visual design, due to
its gorgeous fantasy-like scenes. The most horrific/shocking imagery
emanates from [The Last King of Scotland], a scene that showcases the
aftermath of the cheating wife.

## action

The best
action sequence is to be found in the final battle in *The
Kingdom*. The best chase sequence is to be found in the very first scene
of *District B13*, where the very athletic hero saves his neck from some
very unloving fellows.

## miscellaneous

[Munich] ties with *Cars* as regards the best sound. There's a tie
between *The Number 23* and *Lucky Number Slevin* (presentation of
textual info and the slick murders) as the best opening credits
sequence. The runner-up is *The Kingdom*. *Next* wins both
most romantic scene (the definition of beauty) and most painful scene
(wheelchair explosion) even though both their impact was painfully
reduced on a revisit. The movie also offers best concept (seeing the
future in a mere 2 minutes). Runner-up happens to be *Solaris*, whose
concept is reminiscent of that of *Sphere* and therefore not so fresh.
*Solaris* is also runner-up for most surreal, winner by far being the
unbearably weird *The Fountain*. [The Last King of Scotland] had the
best music, [Apocalypto] had the best costume design, and *Five Fingers*
had the best twist. The most overrated movie turns out to be *Vertigo*,
which frequently appears in many elevated lists of the all-time greatest
movies. Instead of a landmark, I saw a badly-acted old-time thriller,
not a bit better than those Humphrey Bogart flicks. The runner-up is
*The Searchers* which lacked anything commendable, bar some nice images
during the final battle.

## special mention

Something like *Alpha Dog* has not quite been done before and therefore
maintains amazing levels of freshness given various moments (the angry
telephone call, Justin Timberlake's cool) even though it remains
pointless. Another special mention should go to *Devil's Rejects* for
its crazy storyline of killers-for-fun and gruesome violence,
reminiscent of *Natural Born Killers*.

## best first-time viewing experiences

As anyone knows and as seen many times above, movies never offer the
same experience when revisited. So here's a listing of those which were
most impressive on first viewing in order of which had the most impact:
[Apocalypto], *Fearless*, and *Next*.
