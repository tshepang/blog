The best **visual design** in movie history can be found in *300* (a
number of its scenes are worthy of making posters out of). I do wish,
however, this attention to detail was more even, for there's annoying
compositing problems in places, as well as horrible makeup for the
hunchback. The movie also has the my **favorite performance** in its
lead, played by Gerard Butler. He also looks amazing... perfect actually.

Second position in __favorite performance__ category is
[Ewen Bremmer] in _Death At A Funeral_,
playing a delightfully humorous idiot.

The best **story concept** is in [The Man from Earth],
whose lead character is a human that is thousands of years old.
