## movie of the year

[Cloverfield] is the year's greatest spectacle, with the inventive
style popularised by *The Blair Witch Project*, and sweetened with the
year's best visual effects and superb sound. An honorable mention goes
to [Taken].

## direction

Nothing was done better than [No Country
for Old Men].

## misc elements

Best comedy is *Knocked Up*, and the most **enchanting** is the formulaic,
yet effective, *Robots*.

Nothing made me cry in my history of movie-watching as did the drama,
[Kinsey], and there wasn't a movie as bizarre as [Persona], while the
year's best dialogue can be found in [The Squid & the Whale].

As for production design, nothing beats [No Country for Old Men], while
*TMNT* is a runner-up, animated as it is. *No Country for Old Men* also
got the year's best sound, followed by a tie between [30 Days of Night]
and [Cloverfield]. [The New World]'s editing is the year's most
accomplished.

The best dancing can be found in [Step Up 2: The Streets], there's no
better action-thriller than [Taken], while no
horror is better than the chilling [Vacancy]. The best action is found
in [Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children], followed by [Kung Fu Panda].
The best fight is between the characters played by Jet Li and Jacky Chan
in the otherwise shitty and silly [The Forbidden Kingdom].

## misc small things

The year's best escape was the villain's in *Kung Fu Panda*.
The best confrontation was that of the
characters of Craig Bierko and Russel Crowe in a party scene in *The
Cinderella Man*. The best end-credits sequence can be seen in *The
Mummy*, which uses a concept copied from *300*'s end-credits sequence.

*The Condemned* had my favorite sexual interaction (very brief but
complete with beautiful comic touches) and I don't remember a car crash
in movie history as great as that in *Death Proof*.

## performances

The year's performance is easily Heath Ledger's in [The Dark Knight],
and he happens to be the movie's sole redeemer, almost. Other
outstanding male performers are Cuba
Gooding, Jr.'s as dirty cop in *Dirty*, John Carrol Lynch's bit
appearance in [Confidence], and then Stanley Tucci's fashion lover in
*The Devil Wears Prada*. My favorite comic performance is William H.
Macy's in *Wild Hogs*.

The best female performance was by Cate Blanchett's title character as
a daring journalist in *Veronica Guerin*, followed by the surprisingly
excellent Kerry Washington as a slutty girl in *I Think I Love My Wife*.
Ger Ryan (2nd runner-up) really touched me as a loving mother in
*interMission* followed by Ellen Barkin (3rd runner-up) in *Someone Like
You*. That Ger Ryan also ties with Ellen Page's appearance in the
horrifying *Hard Candy* as my favorite female performance. They are
followed by a tie between Katie Holmes' thief in *Mad Money* and
Q'Orianka Kilcher's Pocahontas in [The New World]. The best bit-female
performance is Alexandra Silber's book lover in *Room 1408* which is
the best thing in the movie even though she appears in just one short
scene.

The best cast is a tie between *interMission* (a bunch of memorable and
eccentric characters) and [No Country for Old Men] (a small solid set of
rural American characters). The
best characterisations was in [The New World] for the colorful portrayal
of the Native Americans.

## characters

The **best villain** is Heath Ledger's The Joker in [The Dark Knight],
who is also my most favorite ever. He is followed by Sid Haig's
homorous clown in *House of A Thousand Corpses*.

The most desirable woman is Emelia Burns, the black girl in *The
Condemned*. She's followed by Cate Blanchett in *Veronica Guerin* and
then Shirley Henderson as the emotionally-hurt girl in *interMission*.

There were no characters as cute the young penguins in *Surf's Up*.

My most **favorite creature** is the super-large monster in
[Cloverfield], followed by Pyramid Head in [Silent Hill]. 2nd runner-up
is the hyper-realistic mountain creatures in *The Mummy 3*. The best
**character design** however goes to the villainous Maltazard in *Arthur
& the Invisibles*, followed by the three suits in [Iron Man].

## visuals

The year's most beautiful imagery can be found in *Surf's Up* (the
waves and the hidden beach), with an honorable mention going to *The
Bank Job*, especially its opening scene. *Appleseed* has the year's
best visuals.
