The best **visual effects** can be found in [Iron Man].

My **favorite performance** is that of [Louis Fan] in *Ip Man*,
for the ferocious energy he brings to the role.
He is followed by the delightful (and beautiful) Jordan Prentice in
*In Bruges*.
The most **desirable character** is [Hiroyuki Ikeuchi] in _Ip Man_,
one of the most beautiful men I've yet seen.
