The **best movie** of the year is also the best movie ever to be based
in my city of residence, Johannesburg.
The movie also has **best visuals**,
as its battle suit is the **best visual effects artefact**.
In addition, it's also the **most original** movie, which helps it feel super-fresh.
The movie is named [District 9].

The **best male performance** is that of Christoph Waltz as Nazi officer
in [Inglourious Basterds].
He plays a very fearsome Nazi officer that is so damn easy to hate.

The best **cast** can be found in *Precious*.
Among them is the most **desirable gal**, Amina Robinson,
who plays the more quiet of the classmates, one with scar on face.
Oh man, why do people have to look and be like her. Damn!
