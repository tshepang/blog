The year started with a whole lot of stellar performers but slowed down
later on since I did things other than watch movies. Regardless, that
early period represented some of the best movie years in recent memory.

## best movie

The year's best movie is [Baise-moi], whose unflinching and unsettling
violence has the raw intensity of [Bamboozled]'s climax and the
harshness of _Natural Born Killers_, without the humor.

## performances

My favorite performances are a tie and all go to one movie, [Watchmen]:
Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley when face
is unmasked. Runner-up is [Raffaëla Anderson] as a crazed rape victim in
[Baise-moi].

There was quite a number of superb male performances, the best being
Daniel-Day Lewis' near-flawless performances as oil miner in [There
Will Be Blood]. Here's the runner-ups:

2.  John Malkovich as activist in [Changeling]
3.  Jack Nicholson as grumpy tycoon in _Bucket List_
4.  Woody Harrelson as blind man in [Seven Pounds]

The year's __best female performance__ is a tie between that Rosario
Dawson's as the love interest in [Seven Pounds], and Tilda Swinton's
as fleeting lover in [The Curious Case of Benjamin Button].

## characters

Compared to last year, this year is lacklustre, except for desirable
gals where Golshifteh Farahani ([Body of Lies][Seven Pounds]) and husky
voice (likely Brenda Vaccaro) in [Midnight Cowboy] take the crown.
In second place is
the warrior girl in [Avatar], who/which also happens to be year's
__best creature__.

Character design goes to the talking toys of [Small Soldiers].

## visuals

[2012] has some seriously explosive visual effects, among the best ever.
The runner-ups:

1.  [Transformers 2]
2.  [Avatar]

## misc elements

[There Will Be Blood] has the year's __best direction__. [Changeling]
has __best production design__, and its runner-up is [Shoot 'Em Up],
which however gets __best cinematography__. [Changeling] also has __best
costume design__ and __best cast__.

The year's greatest spectacles are _2012_ and [Avatar]; best thriller
is [Law-Abiding Citizen]; best comedy is [You Don't Mess With the Zohan]; the most
enchanting/delightful is [Wall-E][You Don't Mess With the Zohan],
followed up by [Sponge Bob].

The year's __best action__ movie is [Quantum of Solace], followed by
[Avatar]; the most bizarre is [Ghost Dog], followed by [Watchmen]; the
__funniest__ is _You Don't Mess With the Zohan_, followed by _Yes Man_.

The __most touching__ movie (overall) is [Yellow Earth], a sad
exploration of a hopeless yearning for freedom, which presents itself in
a form of Communist soldier with a weird mission. The __most touching
moments__ is the relationship between the Chinese and Russian lady in
[The World], followed by a childish romance between silly tent
constructor and sweet servant in _Monsoon Wedding_.

The __best opening credits sequence__ is in [Rock 'n Rolla][Shoot 'Em
Up]. The __worst humiliation__ is in near the end of [There Will Be
Blood].
