The **best movie** of the year is also the best movie ever to be based
in my city of residence, Johannesburg.
The movie also has **best visuals**.
In addition, it's also the **most original** movie, which helps it feel super-fresh.
The movie is named [District 9].

The best __visual effects artefact__ is the battle suit of [District 9],
followed by the killer bikes of *Terminator Salvation*.

The **best male performance** is that of Christoph Waltz as Nazi officer
in [Inglourious Basterds].
He plays a very fearsome Nazi officer that is so damn easy to hate.

The best **cast** can be found in *Precious*.
Among them is the most **desirable gal**, Amina Robinson,
who plays the more quiet of the classmates, one with scar on face.
Oh man, why do people have to look and be like her. Damn!

My favorite performance is that of Rosalind Pike,
who plays a mentally challenged lover in *An Education*.
