The __best movie__ of the year is also the best movie ever to be based
in my city of residence, Johannesburg.
The movie also has __best visuals__.
In addition, it's also the __most original__ movie, which helps it feel super-fresh.
The movie is named [District 9].

The best __visual effects artefact__ is the battle suit of [District 9],
followed by the killer bikes of _Terminator Salvation_.

The __best male performance__ is that of Christoph Waltz as Nazi officer
in [Inglourious Basterds].
He plays a very fearsome Nazi officer that is so damn easy to hate.

The best __cast__ can be found in _Precious_.
Among them is the most __desirable character__, played by Amina Robinson.
She is most quiet of the classmates, one with scar on face.
Also, why do people have to look and be like her. Damn!

My __favorite performance__ is that of Rosalind Pike,
who plays a mentally challenged lover in _An Education_.
