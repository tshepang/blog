The **best movie** I have seen this year is
[Somewhere]. The year's **greatest spectacle**, however, is
[Inception], followed by [The A-Team]. The best **direction** is
a tie between [Brooklyn's Finest][Inception]
and [Somewhere].

visuals
=======

The best **cinematography** can be seen in [An Education], followed by
[The Social Network]. The best **visual effects** can be seen in
[Inception], and the best **production design** can be seen in *Death At
A Funeral*... the interior of that home is wonderful. The best
**editing** can be seen in [The Kite Runner][Inception]. The best
**opening credits sequence** is in *Up in the Air*, followed by *An
Education*.

miscellaneous
=============

The best **adventure** movie is *Prince of Persia*, the best **horror**,
*Call Back*, and the most **painful** is *The
Magdalene Sisters*. The **funniest** is *Get Smart*, and most
**enchanting** is *Alice In Wonderland*. The best **action direction**
is in [Takers][Inception].

The best **script/dialogue** is [Memento],
followed by [The Social Network]. The best **narration** can be found in
the most **bizarre** movie of the year, *Sita Sings the Blues*. There
was nothing more **moody** than *Anamorph*.

The best **sound** is a tie between *Up in the Air* and [Somewhere].

acting & characters
===================

There were so many enjoyable performances this year that I couln't
clearly decide who was better than who, and here's an attempt:

The year's most **favorite performance** is that of Jesse Eisenberg in
([The Social Network]), followed by:

1.  a tie between Stanley Tucci & Patricia Clarkson (*Easy A*)
2.  Ron Perlman ([The Job])
3.  homo guy (*Woman On Top*); John Cleese (*Spud*); friend (*Lottery
    Ticket*)

In the category of **best male performance**, Guy Pearce ([Memento])
ties with Woody Harrelson (*The Messenger*).

As for **best female performance**,
we have Meryl Streep in [Sophie's Choice][The Job],
followed by Carrie-Anne Moss in
[Memento], her best performance so far.

My most **favorite character** is the admirable Nelson Mandela (played
by Morgan Freeman) in ([Invictus][The Job]). Runner-up is Rosalind
Pike's superbly gorgeous but dumb-ass blonde in ([An Education]).

The **best child performance** was by the girl palying the daughter in
([Somewhere]), followed by title character in *Spud*.

The best **cast** that of [An Education], followed by that of *Calendar
Girls*.

The best **cast of children** can be found in *Spud*, while the year's
best **villain** is that played of Hades in [Clash of the Titans]
(also the year's most fearsome character),
followed by the tough and smart shooter in [The A-Team].

The most **desirable gal** list follows:

1.  Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air) and Lois character
    ([Superman][Inception])
2.  lover (Last Tango in Paris); Maggie Gyllenhaal (*Crazy Heart*)
3.  bride (*Mamma Mia*); huge eyes (*Outsourced*)
4.  police lady (*Holy Water*)

The most **miserable character** was that of Philip Seymour Hoffman in
*Synecdoche, New York*, which isn't very surpsring since such
characters are his trademark. He's followed very closely by Marlon
Brando's in the disturbing *Last Tango in Paris*.

The best **character design** is the bizarre cyborg trio in [Afro
Samurai: Resurrection], followed by Hades, the villain in [Clash of the
Titans].

The most **charming character** is the cat in *Secret of Kells*. Also,
its eyes reminds me too much of a gal I intensely obsessed over some
years ago.

The most **perfect gentleman** is the oh-so-perfect groom character
in *Our Family Wedding*.

The **koolest guy** is Mark Wahlberg's in *Date Night*, followed by
Justin Timberlake's in [The Social Network].

The best character development ever for a **nerd** can be found in
*Shopgirl*, in a form of an inept lover. As for this year, this is
followed by the schoolboy in [An Education]. As is so common, both
character's shortcomings involve girls.

Here's a list of most **painful/touching scene**:

1.  strapped with bombs ([The Hurt Locker][An Education])
2.  death by insulin ([Memento])
3.  hate for a dead wife (*Last Tango in Paris*) -- leads one
    sympathising with the otherwise unpleasant character
4.  expression of love between cop and prostitute ([Brooklyn's
    Finest][Inception])

The best **dance scene** is the dark, yet enchanting puppet mastery
sequence in *Chicago*. The best **sci-fi set** is the white ship
interior in *Resident Evil Afterlife*, the best **warfare** is in
*Centurion*, the best **story concept** is in [Memento], followed by
[Inception].

Each repeat of a movie is a different experience, hence this category of
**best first-time viewing experience**. This year, it is won by [Iron
Man 2], which failed on the rewatch value department.

'old' movies
==============

This section is meant to give a chance to movies I have watched before
this year to appear in this review, for one reason or another.

Of those, the **best experience** was offered by [Smokin' Aces], which
has now been elevated to a masterpiece. Runner-up is *Reservoir Dogs*,
which remains fresh and exciting after all these years... a rare
quality for a movie indeed.

The **fall from glory** award goes to:

1.  [Se7en] - lost its juice on this revisit
2.  [Malcolm X][The Job] - I considered this a masterpiece at some point
3.  [Human Nature][Inception] - same as above

unpleasantries
==============

The most **boring** movie this year is *A Brighter Summer Day*, followed
by *Afterwards* (no pun intended). The most **overrated** movie is
[Shane][Inception] (dull and lame), followed by *Up*, which doesn't
live anywhere near the high expectations worthy of animated movies of
its stature. The most **overrated villain** is Jack Nicholson as The
Joker in [Batman][Inception]. WTF!
