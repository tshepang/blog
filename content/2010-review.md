*[Iron Man 2]* boasts best **direction** and **dialog**.

*The American* boasts best **sound** (the guns),
and also has the best **suspense**...
you will be so glad you are not in the very uncomfortable situation
the lead finds self in.

The **best performance** is by [Lennie James],
playing an asshole detective in *The Next Three Days*.
Runner-up is in the same movie,
which is by the guy portraying the humorless security officer at airport checkpoint.
My **favorite performance**, however, is that of Guy Pearce,
who plays someone who can't create new memories and has to rely on notes,
in *Memento*.
