I was very surprised when I went through a list of movies I tagged as
excellent, which I watched first time in 2011, and found several. One
problem though is that I can't rank them because I don't fully
remember the experiences of all. Luckily, I know which of the movies is
at the top, [Megamind].

Here's the rest (ranked alphabetically):

-   [Downfall]
-   [Kung Fu Panda 2] (also happens to be the year's **greatest
    spectacle**)
-   [Rabbit Hole]
-   [Sex, Lies, and Videotape]
-   [Tangled]

## visuals

A ranking of the year's **best cinematography**:

1.  [The Seventh Seal]
2.  [The Kings's Speech]
3.  [Shelter]
4.  [Orphan]

As for the year's **best production design**, there is a tie between
[The Kings's Speech] and [Shelter].

The year's **best visual effects (overall)**:

1.  [The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]
2.  [Sucker Punch]
3.  a tie between [Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief]
    and [Tron: Legacy]
4.  it would be sinful not to include [Transformers: Dark of the Moon],
    even though it's pretty much the same offering as the 2 previous
    ones in the franchise.

The year's **best visual effects (specific moments)**:

1.  train crash ([Super 8])
2.  river-god ([The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian])
3.  sea monster ([The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn
    Treader])
4.  wall of water ([The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn
    Treader])
5.  Paris chase by the 2 [exoskeletons] ([G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra])
6.  the storm ([Gulliver's Travels])
7.  trash in the recycling plant ([Toy Story 3]) +++ maybe a cheat since
    this is animation, but I needed to mention it

The year's **best animation** is a tie between [Rango] and [Legend of
the Guardians]. Both offer lengthy moments of hyper-realistic imagery.
The runner-up is [9] with it's wonderful action sequences.

Although the **best action** is offered by [9], the **best action
sequence** is the [exoskeleton][exoskeletons] chase in [G.I. Joe: The
Rise of Cobra]. However, there **most innovative sequence** is the
split-screen bounty hunter scene found in [The Green Hornet].

## performances

My **favorite performance** is that of [Andie MacDowell] when playing
the sweet love interest in [Sex, Lies, and Videotape]. First runner-up
is a tie between Vera Farmica as sad mother ([Orphan]) and [Jon de
Lancie] as lead of pathology ([Pathology]). 2nd runner-up is Sandra Oh
([Rabbit Hole]).

The **best male performance** is by Geoffrey Rush when playing a
therapist in [The Kings's Speech].
The runner-up is [Miles Teller] in [Rabbit Hole].

The **best female performance** is by Nicole Kidman in [Rabbit Hole],
and the **best cast** is from the same movie. Maybe it's a distant
second, but the runner-up on that category is [Pathology]. The **best
voice talent** is that of [Rango].

## characters

As regards the **best character development**, James Spader's
free-spirited character in [Sex, Lies, and Videotape] ties with Nicole
Kidman's grieving asshole in [Rabbit Hole]. Runner-up is the evil
peacock in [Kung Fu Panda 2], the same peacock that happens to be the
year's **best villain**. Despite his cruelty, his oft-humorous demeanor
made me care about him, which is the sort of quality I find exceptional
in terms of character development of villains.

The **best character design** is that of the main villain in [9],
followed by the ninjas in [The Warrior's Way].

The year's **most desirable woman** is [Sandra Oh] in [Rabbit Hole],
playing a small role as the love interest. Watching this has changed my
view of her... I want her, now! Here's the runner-ups:

1.  [Andie MacDowell] ([Sex, Lies, and Videotape])
2.  [Teri Hatcher] ([Tango & Cash])
3.  [Jill Schoelen] ([The Stepfather])

[According to Greta] boasts both the **most perfect gentleman** (the
lead's boyfriend) and the **most perfect father** (the lead's
grandpa).

The **best comic character** is the fat guy in [She's Out of My
League], followed by a tie between Jack Black's partner in [Nacho
Libre] and the fat oversexed woman in [Nanny McPhee And The Big Bang].

## miscellaneous

The category of **most important movie** exists in order to recognize
movies that deliver certain ideas/messages I find extremely important.
[Fair Game],
which is about harmful suppression of truth by powerful government officials,
wins this one.

Each repeat of a movie is a different experience, hence this category of
**best first-time viewing experience**. It's won by [Megamind] (it blew
my mind away due to its seeming perfection) and the runner-up is [Shrek
Forever After], which sadly couldn't survive a revisit.

The **worst revisit** was [Shrek Forever After]. I deemed it a
masterpiece on first viewing, but it seemed a different (and worse)
movie on a revisit. Not that it was trash. It was just not very good.
The runner-up is [The Warrior's Way].

As for the year's **best script/dialog**, we have [Sex, Lies, and Videotape].

The year's **funniest movie** is
[Being There], followed by a tie between
[Brewster's Millions] (surprising entrant) and [Semi-Pro].

The year's **most enchanting** movie is [Megamind], followed by
[Tangled].

The year's **most original story** is that of **The Idiots** (the
subject matter of conmen is fairly popular yes, but in here is the added
twist of the perpetrators not having any material gain out of it). The
runner-up is [Dark Matter], followed by [Pathology]. The **best story
concept** can be seen in [Groundhog Day], where the lead character
experiences the same day over and over again.

I don't really pay much attention to this one, but I'll give the
**best make-up** honor to [Pathology] for making corpses look so
convincing.

The **most overrated** movie is [Sunset Boulevard] followed by [All
About Eve]. The former is substandard while the second is quite decent.

## 'old' movies

This section is meant to give a chance to movies I have watched before
this year to appear in this review, for one reason or another.
