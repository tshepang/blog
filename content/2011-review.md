The best movie of the year is *Contagion*,
boasting **best direction** (so realistic, also fast-paced),
**best dialog** (so fresh),
**best cast** (it has several big actors, all of whom went beyond their famous personas),
and **best editing** (so smooth).

My **favorite performance** is that of [Andrew Howard] as the Russian
gangster in *Limitless*. The movie also has my most **favorite story
concept**, that of a drug that vastly improves mental performance.

The most **desirable gal** is [Kelly Reilly] in [Sherlock Holmes: A Game
of Shadows]. She is followed by [Marion Cotillard] in *Contagion*.
