The __best movie of the year__ is _Contagion_,
boasting __best direction__ (so realistic, also fast-paced),
__best dialog__ (so fresh),
__best cast__ (it has several big actors, all of whom went beyond their famous personas),
and __best editing__ (so smooth).

My __favorite performance__ is that of [Andrew Howard] as the Russian
gangster in _Limitless_, followed by...

- Cuba Gooding, jnr. in _The Hit List_
- Stephen Fry in _Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows_
- Jared Harris, also in _Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows_
- Jeff Chase, in _The Mechanic_

_Limitless_ also has my most favorite __story concept__,
that of a drug that vastly improves mental performance.

_Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows_ itself also has
the most __desirable character__ in [Kelly Reilly].
She is followed by [Marion Cotillard] in _Contagion_.
