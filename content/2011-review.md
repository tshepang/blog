The best movie of the year is *Contagion*,
boasting **best direction** (so realistic, also fast-paced),
**best dialog** (so fresh),
**best cast** (it has several big actors, all of whom went beyond their famous personas),
and **best editing** (so smooth).

My **favorite performance** is that of [Andrew Howard] as the Russian
gangster in *Limitless*, followed by...

- Cuba Gooding, jnr. in *The Hit List*
- Stephen Fry in *Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows*
- Jared Harris, also in *Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows*
- Jeff Chase, in *The Mechanic*

*Limitless* also has my most **favorite story
concept**, that of a drug that vastly improves mental performance.

*Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows* itself also has
the most **desirable gal** in [Kelly Reilly].
She is followed by [Marion Cotillard] in *Contagion*.
