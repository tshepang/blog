I don\'t remember a movie whose visual effects are of this scale, and
only those of *King Kong* [are superior]. The early scenes are much fun,
with nice superficial touches reminiscent of [Transformers]. The whole
thing is dragged by some family drama as well as an uninteresting John
Cusack. Me loves the designs of the arks. The \'chase\' scenes, all an
excuse to showcase the extravaganza that is the effects, are pure fun. I
also enjoyed the large Russian billionaire, an otherwise unconvincing
buffoon that offers much comic relief.
