It is a pity that this year lacks any excellent movies, never mind a
masterpiece. This makes [last year] far better and this among the worst.
This does not mean there was nothing to celebrate of course.

## visuals

The best __visual effects (overall)__:

1.  [The Avengers]
3.  [Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]

In terms of specifics, there was nothing better than the battle between
Voldermort and Dumbledore in that last listing, and the climactic battle
in [The Avengers] is runner-up.

The best __action__ is offered by [The Avengers], while
the best __hand-to-hand combat sequence__ is the fight that takes place
in a diner in [Haywire].

The best __animation__ is, interestingly, an insert (in [Harry Potter
and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1]), which tells the story of the Deathly
Hallows.

The best __opening credits sequence/visuals__ are from [True Legend],
followed by those from [The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo]. As for best
__ending credits sequence/visuals__, the honor goes to [Harry Potter and
the Half-Blood Prince].

Although I hate the movie, I have to admit that best __production
design__ is found in [J. Edgar].

## performances

My __favorite performance__ is that of Charlotte Gainsbourg ([The Science of Sleep]).

The __best performance__ is a tie between Annette Bening &
Julianne Moore in [The Kids Are All Right]. Runner-up is Charlotte
Gainsbourg in [The Science of Sleep], who is just about the movie's
saving grace.

The best __child performance__ is by Dakota Goyo, the son in [Real
Steel], while the best __cast__ is in [The Iron Lady].

My favorite __voice acting__ is Tom Hardy (Bane) ([The Dark Knight
Rises]), even though it's hard to hear at times.

## characters

My __favorite character__ is the son ([Dakota Goyo]) in [Real Steel],
while my __favorite villain__ is Bane (Tom Hardy) in [The Dark Knight Rises].

The most __desirable character__ is Charlotte Gainsbourg as main love interest
in [The Science of Sleep]... so hard to resist! She is followed by
Brooke White as wife and new mother in [Change of Plans].

The __best character design__ is the Chitauri, the alien race in [The
Avengers].

The best __comic characters__:

1.  Ken Jeong ([The Hangover Part II])
2.  Lucy Punch ([Bad Teacher])
3.  Justin Timberlake ([Bad Teacher]) (tie) master butler ([Bob the
    Butler])
4.  Ben Stiller ([Zoolander])

The __worst asshole__ was Marlon Brando's character in [A Streetcar
Named Desire].

## miscellaneous

The most __funny__ movies:

2.  [Horrible Bosses]
3.  [The Hangover Part II]
4.  [Zoolander]

Each repeat of a movie is a different experience, hence the category,
__best first-time viewing experience__. This year, it's won by the
year's __greatest spectacle__, [The Avengers]. Runner-up is [Gone Baby
Gone], and that's because it was so gripping that I thought it would be
a great contender for best movie of the year. A revisit was not so
great.

The most __bizarre__ movie is [Battle In Heaven], and the __false
promise__ award goes to [Zombieland]. It wins for being so exciting and
sorta fresh when it starts, but screwing up with lack of content later
on.

The most __overrated__ movie is [A Nightmare on Elm Street], followed by
[A Streetcar Named Desire]. That second is hailed a masterpiece by weird
people.

## 'old' movies

This section is meant to give a chance to movies I have watched before
this year to appear in this review, for one reason or another.

Of those, the __best experience__ was offered by _Being John Malkovich_,
which led me to elevate it to a [masterpiece]. Runner-up is [Taken],
which remains as intense and exciting as ever.

The __fall from glory__ award goes to:

-   [Vicky Cristina Barcelona]: I enjoyed this massively first time I
    watched it 2 years ago; it now feels pretentious and cheap/shallow,
    like something I would write if I were to try.
-   [Perfume]: It is sad that I used to consider this a masterpiece.
    It remains good, just nowhere near the top.
