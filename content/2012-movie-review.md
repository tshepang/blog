It is a pity that this year lacks any excellent movies, never mind a
masterpiece. This makes [last year] far better and this among the worst.
This does not mean there was nothing to celebrate of course.

## visuals

The best **visual effects (overall)**:

1.  [The Avengers]
3.  [Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]

In terms of specifics, there was nothing better than the battle between
Voldermort and Dumbledore in that last listing, and the climactic battle
in [The Avengers] is runner-up.

The best **action** is offered by [The Avengers], while
the best **hand-to-hand combat sequence** is the fight that takes place
in a diner in [Haywire].

The best **animation** is, interestingly, an insert in ([Harry Potter
and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1]), which tells the story of the Deathly
Hallows.

The best **opening credits sequence/visuals** are from [True Legend],
followed by those from [The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo]. As for best
**ending credits sequence/visuals**, the honor goes to [Harry Potter and
the Half-Blood Prince].

Although I hate the movie, I have to admit that **best production
design** is found in [J. Edgar].

## performances

My **favorite performance** is that of Charlotte Gainsbourg ([The Science of Sleep]).

The **best female performance** is a tie between Annette Bening &
Julianne Moore in [The Kids Are All Right]. Runner-up is Charlotte
Gainsbourg in [The Science of Sleep], who is just about the movie's
saving grace.

The best **child performance** is by Dakota Goyo, the son in [Real
Steel], while the best **cast** is in [The Iron Lady].

My favorite **voice acting** is Tom Hardy (Bane) ([The Dark Knight
Rises]), even though it's hard to hear at times.

## characters

The best **character development** is the father of the title character
(Jack Lemmon) in [Missing], followed by the wife (Sissy Spacek) in the
same movie. My **favorite character** is however the son ([Dakota Goyo])
in [Real Steel],
while my **favorite villain** is Bane (Tom Hardy) in [The Dark Knight Rises].

The most **desirable gal** is Charlotte Gainsbourg as main love interest
[The Science of Sleep] (I really loved this girl!). Here are the
runner-ups:

1.  Brooke White as wife and new mother ([Change of Plans])
2.  Sissy Spacek as wife ([Missing])

The **best character design** is the Chitauri, the alien race in [The
Avengers].

The best **comic characters**:

1.  Ken Jeong ([The Hangover Part II])
2.  Lucy Punch ([Bad Teacher])
3.  Justin Timberlake ([Bad Teacher]) (tie) master butler ([Bob the
    Butler])
4.  Ben Stiller ([Zoolander])

The **worst asshole** was Marlon Brando's character in [A Streetcar
Named Desire].

## miscellaneous

The most **funny** movies:

2.  [Horrible Bosses]
3.  [The Hangover Part II]
4.  [Zoolander]

The best **script/dialogue** is in [Missing].

Each repeat of a movie is a different experience, hence the category,
**best first-time viewing experience**. This year, it's won by the
year's **greatest spectacle**, [The Avengers]. Runner-up is [Gone Baby
Gone], and that's because it was so gripping that I thought it would be
a great contender for best movie of the year. A revisit was not so
great.

The most **bizarre** movie is [Battle In Heaven], and the **false
promise** award goes to [Zombieland]. It wins for being so exciting and
sorta fresh when it starts, but screwing up with lack of content later
on.

The most **overrated** movie is [A Nightmare on Elm Street], followed by
[A Streetcar Named Desire]. That second is hailed a masterpiece by weird
people.

## 'old' movies

This section is meant to give a chance to movies I have watched before
this year to appear in this review, for one reason or another.

Of those, the **best experience** was offered by *Being John Malkovich*,
which led me to elevate it to a [masterpiece]. Runner-up is [Taken],
which remains as intense and exciting as ever.

The **fall from glory** award goes to:

-   [Vicky Cristina Barcelona][]: I enjoyed this massively first time I
    watched it 2 years ago; it now feels pretentious and cheap/shallow,
    like something I would write if I were to try.
-   [Perfume][]: It is sad that I used to consider this a masterpiece.
    It remains good, just nowhere near the top.
