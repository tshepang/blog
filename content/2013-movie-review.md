Not such a great year at the movies, even worse than [last year], though
I think I also watched a lot less movies. Luckily there's two excellent
ones, the best being [In Bruges]. It also boasts the year's best
**direction**, **cinematography**, and **script/dialog**. The other
excellent movie is [Redbelt].

## visuals

[Man of Steel] has the best
**action sequence**, the first battle with second-in-command of Zod. The
movie also has the best **visual effects**, followed by [Elysium].

## performances

My **favorite performance** is that of Tom Towles playing Otis in
[Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer]. Runner-up is the hypnotized lady
in [Now You See Me], followed by [Michael Parks] in [Django Unchained].
The **best male performance** is by [Chiwetel Ejiofor] as an instructor
in [Redbelt].

## characters

My **favorite character** is the honorable martial arts instructor in
[Redbelt], played by Chiwetel Ejiofor. The most **desirable gal** is the
love interest in [In Bruges].

The best **character design** is the fearsome The Missionary in [Silent
Hill: Revelation], followed by the bizarre floating giants in
[MirrorMask].

## miscellaneous

The most **important** movie is [The Thaw] due to its well-delivered
story, which is related to the consequences of global warming.
There is a tie for the most **bizarre** movie: [Cloud
Atlas] and [MirrorMask].

The most **innovative** movie is the satirical [Goodbye Uncle Tom][]:
it's shot like a documentary in which the makers travel to a
particularly horrid moment in United States history, yet treating it
with humor... very daring.

The title for **best 'old' movie experience** goes to [Payback]. This
a title for a movie I've seen before this year. A special mention
should go to the [Director's Cut version], which I saw first time in
2013.
