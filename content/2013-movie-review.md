Not such a great year at the movies, even worse than [last year], though
I think I also watched a lot less movies. Luckily there's an
excellent movie, [Redbelt].

## visuals

[Man of Steel] has the best
**action sequence**, the first battle with second-in-command of Zod. The
movie also has the best **visual effects**.

## performances

My **favorite performance** is that of Tom Towles playing Otis in
[Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer]. Runner-up is the hypnotized lady
in [Now You See Me], followed by [Michael Parks] in [Django Unchained].
The **best male performance** is by [Chiwetel Ejiofor] as an instructor
in [Redbelt].

## characters

My **favorite character** is the honorable martial arts instructor in
[Redbelt], played by Chiwetel Ejiofor.

The best **character design** is the fearsome The Missionary in [Silent
Hill: Revelation].

## miscellaneous

The most **innovative** movie is the satirical [Goodbye Uncle Tom]:
it's shot like a documentary in which the makers travel to a
particularly horrid moment in United States history, yet treating it
with humor... very daring.
