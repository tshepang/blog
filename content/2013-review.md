[Her] boasts best __editing__, best __cinematography__, and most
__exciting story concept__.
*Elysium* has the best __visual design__:
see the vehicles (especially the gorgeous one carrying the billionaire),
the robot police, and the ring world.

The most __desirable character__ is that of [Rachelle Lefevre] in *White House Down*.

The most __surprising movie__ is _No Man's Land_,
because it is the only China movie I watched that is either a dark comedy or a Western.
