This year was rather sad: I didn't see any fresh movie (movies I saw
first time) above **good** rating (5/7). That is, there wasn't anything
at the excellent level (6/7), never mind a masterpiece (7/7). That also
means nothing stood out enough to be labeled **best movie of the year**.
Regardless, there was still much to celebrate. Let's see.

## visuals

The best **production design** is in [Doubt].

The best **visual design** is in [Upside Down], followed by [The Hunger
Games: Catching Fire].

The best **cinematography** is in [Doubt].

The best **visual effects** are in [Thor: The Dark World], followed by
[Transformers: Age of Extinction], then [Edge of Tomorrow].

## performances

Following is the ranking of the **best male performances**:

2.  Anthony Hopkins in [Red 2]
4.  Geoffrey Rush in [The Book Thief]
5.  [Michael Shannon] in [Premium Rush]
6.  Brad Pitt in [The Counselor]

The **best female performance** was given by Emily Watson in [The Book Thief].

## characters

My **favorite character** is the adoptive father in [The Book Thief],
played by Geoffrey Rush. He's followed by the charming China Doll in
*Oz the Great and Powerful*, which is about as cute and lovable as
characters get. In third place is Valka, the mother of the lead
character in [How To Train Your Dragon 2].

The most **desirable gal** is [Dania Ramirez] in [Premium Rush]

There was no better **character design** than the giant samurai robot in
[The Wolverine]. In second place is the Alpha dragon from [How To Train
Your Dragon 2].

## miscellaneous

There was no
greater **spectacle** than [Edge of Tomorrow].

The following have the best **story concept**:

1.  [Upside Down]
2.  [In Time]
4.  [Her]
5.  [The Purge: Anarchy]
6.  [13 Sins]
