This year was rather sad: I didn't see any fresh movie (movies I saw
first time) above __good__ rating (5/7). That is, there wasn't anything
at the excellent level (6/7), never mind a masterpiece (7/7). That also
means nothing stood out enough to be labeled __best movie of the year__.
Regardless, there was still much to celebrate. Let's see.

## visuals

The best __visual design__ is in [The Hunger Games: Catching Fire].

The best __visual effects__ are in [Thor: The Dark World], followed by
[Transformers: Age of Extinction].

## performances

Following is the ranking of the __best male performances__:

2.  Anthony Hopkins in [Red 2]
4.  Geoffrey Rush in [The Book Thief]
5.  [Michael Shannon] in [Premium Rush]
6.  Brad Pitt in [The Counselor]

The __best female performance__ was given by Emily Watson in [The Book Thief].

## characters

My __favorite character__ is the adoptive father in [The Book Thief],
played by Geoffrey Rush. He's followed by the charming China Doll in
_Oz the Great and Powerful_, which is about as cute and lovable as
characters get. In third place is Valka, the mother of the lead
character in [How To Train Your Dragon 2].

The most __desirable character__ is that of [Dania Ramirez] in [Premium Rush]

There was no better __character design__ than the giant samurai robot in
[The Wolverine]. In second place is the Alpha dragon from [How To Train
Your Dragon 2].

## miscellaneous

The following have the best __story concept__:

2.  [In Time]
4.  [Her]
5.  [The Purge: Anarchy]
6.  [13 Sins]
