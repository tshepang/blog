The best **action** can be found in the fight scenes of *[Non-Stop]*, but
the best **visual effects** are in *[Dracula Untold]*. The best
**animation** is in *[Big Hero 6]*, a movie that also has my **favorite
character**, the inflatable robot.
My **favorite performance** is by Michael Rooker as the leader of the
bandits in *Guardians of the Galaxy*.
The **best performance**, however, is by Johnny Harris,
playing the leader of a team of soldiers in *Monsters: Dark Continent*.
