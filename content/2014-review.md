The best **action** can be found in the fight scenes of [Non-Stop], but
the best **visual effects** are in [Dracula Untold]. The best
**animation** is in [Big Hero 6], a movie that also has my **favorite
character**, the inflatable robot.
My **favorite performance** is by Michael Rooker as the leader of the
bandits in *Guardians of the Galaxy*.
