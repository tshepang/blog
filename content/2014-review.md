The greatest __spectacle__ is *Edge of Tomorrow*.
It also has the best **visual effects**,
as well as the best __visual effects artefact__ in the form of the battle suites.
The best **animation** is in *[Big Hero 6]*,
a movie that also has my **favorite character**,
the inflatable robot.

My **favorite performance** is by Michael Rooker,
playing the leader of the bandits in *Guardians of the Galaxy*.
It is followed by that of Nate Parker in *Non-Stop*,
and is enhanced by the exciting character transformation near the end.
The **best performance**, however, is by Johnny Harris,
playing the leader of a team of soldiers in *Monsters: Dark Continent*.
Following that is one by Tom Wilkinson, playing a sad detective in *Good People*.
