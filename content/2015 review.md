The best **visual effects** can be found in the Hulk vs. Hulkbuster
battle of [Avengers: Age of Ultron]. Runner-up is the title character of
[Chappie]. The greatest **spectacle** is [Jurassic World], whose visual
effects aren\'t shabby either.

The best **direction** can be found in [The Survivalist], followed by
[Spotlight], which itself boasts best **editing** and **dialog**.

My **favorite performance** is that of Benedict Wong in [The Martian],
while my **favorite villain** is Scarlet, the lead villain of [Minions].
That movie also boasts best **visual design**. My **favorite character**
is Ultron, the lead villain in [Avengers: Age of Ultron] The most
**desirable gal** is Sonoya Mizuno in [Ex Machina], which also happens
to have the **best dialog**.
