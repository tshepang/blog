The **best movie** of the year is [Captain Fantastic]. The movie also
boasts **best direction**, and **best script**.

The best **visual effects** can be found in [Deadpool], a movie that
also boasts best **action direction** and **humor**.

My **favorite character** is Black Panther ([Captain America: Civil
War]), and runner-up is Leslie Jones in [Ghostbusters]. The **best
performance** is by Simon Helberg in [Florence Foster Jenkins], while
the best **character design** is that of the Hollows of [Miss
Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children].
