The best **visual effects** can be found in [Deadpool], a movie that
also boasts best **action direction** and **humor**.
The best **sound** can be found in *Arrival*,
one used to represent alien verbal communication.

My **favorite character** is Black Panther ([Captain America: Civil
War]), and runner-up is Leslie Jones in [Ghostbusters]. The **best
performance** is by Simon Helberg in [Florence Foster Jenkins], while
the best **character design** is that of the Hollows of [Miss
Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children].
My __favorite performance__ is that of [Annalise Basso],
due to the fierce and intense persona in _Captain Fantastic_.
