The **best performance** is given by Holly Hunter in *The Big Sick*.
Her character also forms half of **best romantic couple**,
together with Ray Romano. Ray also happens to give a wonderful performance
(and I must note that I don't remember experiencing his work before).
This couple is probably the best I've yet seen.
