_Okja_ has a __favorite performance__ tie,
between Tilda Swinton (playing head of a powerful company) and Byun Hee-bong (playing grandfather).
Both offer beautiful and unusual humor.
The __best performance__, however, is that of Jonathan Pryce in _The Wife_.

_Good Time_ has best __cast__ and best __dialog__.

_The Foreigner_ is the most __surprising__ movie,
mixing political drama, terrorism, and martial arts, all in an unusual setting that is UK.
