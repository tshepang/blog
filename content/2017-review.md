My **favorite performance** is a tie between Tilda Swinton (playing
head of a powerful company) and Byun Hee-bong (playing grandfather) in *Okja*.
Both offer beautiful and unusual humor.
The __best performance__, however, is that of Jonathan Pryce in _The Wife_.

_Good Time_ has best __cast__ and best __dialog__.
