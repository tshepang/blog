_Cuties_ is __movie of the year__,
due to it telling a story from a perspective I've not seen before,
and due to the significance of the message,
that of the strong need to take care of the emotional wellbeing of girls.
This is not a new message,
but I don't remember it being captured in this fresh a manner.

My __favorite performance__ is that of [Amy Madigan] in _The Hunt_,
a movie that also has the most __surprising plot__.

The most __desirable character__ is a tie between those of...
- [Cristin Milioti] in _Palm Springs_
- [Mahtab Servati] in _There is No Evil_
  (in the _Birthday_ segment, a segment which also has the most __beautiful settings__)
