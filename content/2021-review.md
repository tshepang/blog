The most __fresh__ movie is _Locked Down_, such a delight.
The story, the dialog, the direction, the acting.
Also, Anne Hathaway creates the most __desirable character__ of the year.

The best __cast__ is in _Stowaway_, all the 4 performances, such a pleasure to experience.
My __favorite performance__ is a magnetic one by [Toby Huss] in _Copshop_,
playing an especially insidious killer.
The same movie also has the __best action sequence__,
where hero cop escapes that killer, while changing door password.
