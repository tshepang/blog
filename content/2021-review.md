My **favorite cast** is in *Stowaway*,
all the 4 performances,
such a pleasure to experience.
My **favorite performance** is a magnetic one by [Toby Huss] in _Copshop_,
playing a especially insidious killer.
The same movie also has the __best action sequence__,
where hero cop escapes that killer, while changing door password.
