My __favorite cast__ is in _Stowaway_,
all the 4 performances,
such a pleasure to experience.
My __favorite performance__ is a magnetic one by [Toby Huss] in _Copshop_,
playing an especially insidious killer.
The same movie also has the __best action sequence__,
where hero cop escapes that killer, while changing door password.
