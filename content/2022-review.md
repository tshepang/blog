The greatest __spectacle__ is *Black Adam*,
due to its fun action,
especially the early sequences following the awakening of the lead character.
The best __action sequence__ is the prison rescue in *The Bad Guys*...
it does not feel original, but it was so kool, in an otherwise bland movie.

The __best performance__ is that of [Hong Chau] (such perfection!) in *The Menu*.

Following are my __favorite performances__:
1. [Stephanie Hsu] as a fun and colorful villain in _Everything Everywhere All at Once_
1. [Zlatko Burić] as a laid-back and fun-loving passenger in _Triangle of Sadness_
1. [Ronny Chieng] in a fun portrayal of a shitty boss in the uneven _M3GAN_
