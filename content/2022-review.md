The greatest __spectacle__ is *Black Adam*,
due to its fun action,
especially the early sequences following the awakening of the lead character.

My __favorite performance__ is that of [Stephanie Hsu]
as a fun and colorful villain in
*Everything Everywhere All at Once*.
Following that is one by [Ronny Chieng],
a fun portrayal of a shitty boss in the uneven *M3GAN*.
