The __best movie__ is the mesmerizing _El Conde_.
It also has the best __script__
(great dialog that is infused with unusual humor,
and a clever mix of the horror genre with real horrors inflicted by real monsters),
and is probably the best vampire movie ever made.

My __favorite character__ is Nimona in _Nimona_...
fun, powerful, desirable.

The best __comedy performance__ is by [Huang Bo] in _Creation of the Gods I_,
but the best __performance__ is by [Paula Luchsinger] in _El Conde_.

The best __dialogue__ is in _Anatomy of a Fall_.
The quarrel of the married couple is particularly notable.

The best __combat__ is the final one in _Boy Meets World_...
so intense, so brutal.

The __best twist__ is in *Strange Darling*... so surprising!
