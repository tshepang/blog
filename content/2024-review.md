_Anora_ is __movie of the year__,
due to its exciting direction,
fresh writing,
and a story that highlights extreme inequality and the suffering that results.
An example of such suffering is of those doing exotic dancing,
which has never been portrayed with such a level of skill and realism.

The __spectacle of the year__ is *A Quiet Place: Day One*,
complete with incredible creatures and setting,
and very entertaining,
even though none of it is new.

_Flow_ is the most __enchanting__ movie,
with a very touching and mesmerizing story of vertebrates trying to survive some supernatural event,
while also helping (and threatening) each other.

The best __direction__ is that of _Rumours_,
followed by _Joker: Folie à Deux_.

Similarly,
the __best performance__ is by [Nikki Amuka-Bird] in _Rumours_,
followed by Joaquin Phoenix in _Joker: Folie à Deux_.

My __favorite performance__ is that of [Lazare Minoungou],
playing a formerly decorated soldier in _No Chains No Masters_.
