The acting style of Eva Green worked far better in *Dark Shadows*, and
is in fact is embarrassing here. She is as unconvincing as the other
tough gal character, the wife of Leonidas, who had to go as far as being on the
front-line in battle. It's as if someone was desperate to do the girl
power thing, to disastrous effect. Did I say embarrassing?

Anyways, I like the parallel story-line approach, where much of the
events in the movies take place at the same time as those from the
earlier, and far superior, movie. Sadly we do not have an appealing
lead, and in fact not a single character impresses. The battles still
look good, but nowhere near those from the original, nor are the visuals
as amazing. The sex scene was even more stupid than the one in the
original.
