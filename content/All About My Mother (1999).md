Sure it's a decent offering, with good acting from all the females, but
why did it leave such an impression on so many critics? It was all the
rage years back when it was released, but seeing it again, I actually
wonder. I remember appreciating it much more in the first viewing, and I
don't remember why.

One thing that makes it worthy of promotion is it's attempt at removing
prejudice against certain people in society (transvestites and
prostitutes), for there isn't a single important character in the movie
that finds them distasteful. The dialog is pretty good and the character
of the lead tranvestite delightful, though I'm not sure about the
quality of the performance.
