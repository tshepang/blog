I praised the costume and production design when the movie began, but
not later on. I either stopped caring, or the excellence wasn\'t
sustained somehow, I just don\'t know. I was also impressed by the 2
ladies who portrayed Queen Elizabeth I. The conspiracy story wasn\'t so
riveting since I\'ve heard it before (and I don\'t care much since I
think Shakespeare is overrated, either that or I\'m not smart/cultured
enough to enjoy his work). The movie is however very well-made, and non
of it bores at all, even though it loses steam part-way through.
