The lead character from [the first movie] takes a backseat somewhat,
making way for the cyborg friend and former lover, and to a lesser
extent, the lover\'s clone, as well as to multiple other key characters.
It\'s an interesting concept actually, and I haven\'t seen it explored
before: that the clone looks and acts so much like the former lover
presents a challenge, and the conflict is apparent, but not overdone.

The director, who also directed the first movie, has worsened his
obsession with beautiful people. There\'s a lot more of them here,
although I did really like a senior representative of some weapons
manufacturing company named Poseidon. She\'s presented with greater
admiration than the lead.

The action does not offer any real improvement over the previous movie,
even though the budget is 3 times as large. It\'s also not as
interesting. The animation is of more consistent quality than the first
movie, but there\'s nothing really groundbreaking.

**sidenote**: Why the fuck did they have to drastically change the
physical look of Athena (basically the president of the city) so much?
She\'s not even recognizable.
