good
====

-   The best thing in the movie is the tribal humanoid creatures; they
    are given solid and believable personalities, as if they actually
    exist. The best work is the leading lady, who also happens to be
    damn fucking' desirable. I also loved the female spiritual leader
    (she got presence).
-   The entire experience of those humanoids riding flying creatures is
    pure movie magic. The creatures they ride are quite impressive
    (check for example when our hero is to tame one for the first time).
-   The concept of Avatars is quite unique and fresh... it would be
    interesting to experience another body.

bad
===

-   The human characters were not given quality treatment, all but the
    lead (the image of him and his wheelchair is iconic). Most
    unconvincing is the scarred military leader, followed by the
    corporate representative (Giovanni Ribisi).
-   The general feel of the alien world feels too artificial (there's
    too many bright-colored plants and animals). The creature design is
    not satisfactory.
-   The helicopter driver lady should have been excluded. She is just
    not an interesting actor, and cheapens the movie further.

what others feel
================

-   I liked this [short analysis] of the movie.
-   One commenter [correctly noted] stylistic similarities to the
    much-deplored Jar Jar Binks of Star Wars fame.
-   I also enjoyed a [disapproving review] by a famous inventor and
    futurist, Ray Kurzweil.
