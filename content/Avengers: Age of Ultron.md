I was not so impressed when I saw this one first time:

I did, however, love something in it:

I still do love the scene, but I love the villain even more. The writers
did a great job to demonstrate the fact that this character is a
super-intelligence, making him quite unusual and unpredictable,
resulting in it being unlike any character I've seen. I love his
various appearances: birth, broken robot, first meeting with the twins,
the severed arm, and the self-killing (in which he occupies a more
shitty body).
