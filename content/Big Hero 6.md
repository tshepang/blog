The level of fantasy in [Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs] went to
ridiculous levels, but this one is even worse. As was the case with
Cloudy, it started very well, mostly with the help of the cute, chubby,
and funny air-filled robot, but devolves into super-lazy writing with
too many holes, and an overly-skilled teenage engineer. Making things
worse is some bad recycled plot points, an example being the apologetic
moment our (very uninteresting) lead character gets to have after doing
something unbearably stupid. All this spoils the various good spots the
movie offers.
