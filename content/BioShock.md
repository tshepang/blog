I enjoyed a [negative review of BioShock] partly because everything else
I\'ve read so far was full of praise, and partly because, immersive as
it is, really is overrated. For one, I couldn\'t believe that I was
restricted to basically one environment, and I got so lost around the
repetitive-looking environment just as I was in *Halo: Combat Evolved*
(a superior game, even considering it was released over 5 years
earlier).

What I like about the game:

-   an amazing array of genetic weapons
-   great art direction
-   the fearsome Big Daddies
-   an appealing gloomy storyline of genetic engineering gone awry

The whole thing did alert me what a tremendously useful tool 3D games
could be as exploration tools to unfamiliar worlds. Note that I\'ve
lived through such an experience with the vastly underrated *Conflict:
Desert Storm*.
