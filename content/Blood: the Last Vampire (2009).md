Some of the imagery is beautiful, and so is the lead character. The
scene in the car with father and daughter is surprisingly good, and does
not fit the movie. That daughter is given the movie\'s best performance.
The ends feels rushed\... lazy writing. The demons are among some of the
worst creature designs ever in movies\... there must have been a problem
with the budget.
