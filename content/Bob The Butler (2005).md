It's a recycled story of a guy who appears to be a loser, but happens
to be quite useful when put in some specific situation. I appreciate it
because, regardless of being formulaic and shallow, it feels fresh --
it has unusual, laid-back direction, and quality comic performances from
the lead and, most especially, the master butler. It screws up with
it's needless use of slapstick.
