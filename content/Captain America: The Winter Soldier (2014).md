Far superior to [the disgusting original], this one is even better than
[The Avengers], even without Hulk and Iron Man. The action sequences are
intense, though excessive (think *The Transformers*), but not too
frantic. My favorite action sequence is the Fury chase. The abilities of
the Winter Soldier matched that of Captain America, making him fun to
watch. I would have done without the flying guy (Falcon), who happens to
be overly skillful, like he was some super-human, which he's not. Same
applies to the Black Widow character. The story is okay but does not
rise above the feeling that it attempts nothing other than keep the
franchise going. There's lots of shortcuts, and not much depth.
