I found the writing and direction excellent, and the acting very
competent. The funeral was very touching, and its simplicity admirable.

As a minor complaint, I wish grandpa, the only real adversary in the
movie, was not so soon forgotten by the writers. Also, I suspect a less
fairy-taily ending would have made for an even better movie.

Regardless, the whole thing offers a fantastic (and refreshing)
examination of a self-educated and self-sufficient family.
