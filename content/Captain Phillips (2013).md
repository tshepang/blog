I hardly ever enjoy Tom Hanks performances, but this one was very
watchable, though his best moments are only at the very end, after his
rescue. I also enjoyed watching the lead of the pirates, which is a
rather unusual casting choice. He is also the most interesting character
in the movie, a villain that provides comfort for his victim, and [a
villain we get to care for].

One other special thing about the movie is the subject matter, which I
don't remember ever seeing explored before in movies: modern-day ship
piracy. Another special thing is the attention to detail regarding the
cargo ship, which is also a rare sight. The direction is of decent
quality and so is the tension.

The movie could be shorter though, and the numerous attempts by the
title character to prevail are tiring. The movie also moves too quick
from Somalia to the seas... there is not enough exploration of the
background of our villains.
