[Brooke White], the lead female performer, scores quite high on the
desirability charts, while the music her character does sucks hard. The
movie feels fresh (it\'s not your typical pro-family fare), but not the
\"family about to break apart\" moment near the end, which is just too
common. Worse is that it\'s annoying and feels contrived (and a better
actor should have been in the place of the government lady). The
attitude the older girl shows is also just too common, but it\'s a
decent performance.
