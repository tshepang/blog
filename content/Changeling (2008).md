The movie has some great elements: production design, costume design,
cinematography, direction, and cast, especially John Malkovich, who
gives his best performance I've yet seen. The story itself is okay
enough, but I enjoyed it a lot more on the first viewing. I also enjoyed
Angelina Jolie's performance as grieving mother on that first viewing
than on this revisit, even going as far as calling it her best yet.
