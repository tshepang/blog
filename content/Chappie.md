Hugh Jackman did a good job here, more impressive the anything else
he's done before. It's a pity that his character goes too far into
unconvincing territory where its obsession leads it to do something as
stupid as de-activating the helpful robots. But even more interesting is
the title character: it's humorous, enchanting, and also well-animated
(invisible visual effects). None of the characters are given any depth.
Regardless, the movie is captivating, and has a great ending, fairy tale
as it is.
