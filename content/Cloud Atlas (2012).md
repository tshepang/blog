Bizarre treat, far more enjoyable in its first half. Lots of
bad/uninteresting performances, even from established actors like Halle
Berry, Tom Hanks, and Hugo Weaving. Lots of brutality, pointlessness,
and\... what the fuck is the movie about?

I did enjoy the interview though, and it helps carry the movie along. I
enjoyed watching the guy asking the questions\... decent performance
there. The guy rescuing the heroine is admirable too, though the action
he finds self in is just cartoony. Is this not supposed to be close to
reality?

There are some interesting quotables sprinkled all over the place. My
favorite is one uttered by a master composer after an attempt at a piano
by one apprentice:

> You must have misheard me! I said I had a melody, not a malady!
