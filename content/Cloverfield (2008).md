[I once compared this movie with I Am Legend], and I then I had the
following to say later that year:

All the above are still accurate, except I didn't enjoy the plot as
much this (third) time around. The setup was okay, all but the romance
part of it, which just felt tired. I also found it far-fetched to have
the guy brave the monsters to go rescue gal, and managing to drag around
two more people on his quest onto a heavily-compromised building, up
dozens of stairs, all to find a gal heavily injured, yet managing to run
around for several minutes on end... makes me sad :(
