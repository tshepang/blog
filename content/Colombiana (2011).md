For almost it's entire running length, it's very fast-paced, a fact
that helps hide its incompetence, considering that there's nothing new
or fresh, other than having the first young girl action hero I've seen
yet. Hers portrayal is not convincing, even when grown up. However,
there's a good performance by the guy playing the lead FBI agent
([Lennie James]), who recently impressed me in [The Next Three Days].
The subplot involving the love interest was a waste of time, although it
was well-made, as is the movie in general.
