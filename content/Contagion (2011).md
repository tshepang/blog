A very well-made, rather convincing/realistic (the fresh dialog
contributes well to that), well-acted movie (Laurence Fishburne is a joy
to watch, and so is Gwyneth Paltrow). One favorite scene is when husband
(Matt Damon) is told of passing away of wife while in hospital. The
reaction is quite sad, and perhaps represents the best such scene I\'ve
ever seen.

The movie is quite gloomy, and makes me impatient when we are actually
going to finally manage to be fully immune to disease
(nanomedicine/genetics). The subject matter makes it among the most
important movies ever made.

\[**sidenote**\] A [superb review] whose one criticism (disrespect for
blogging) was on point.
