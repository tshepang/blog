I saw this first time some years ago, and it remains a quality movie.
Pity that it doesn\'t quite reach the levels it attempted to. It\'s
well-made of course, with some decent performances. I just don\'t know
what the point of it all is. For example, it sounds like someone was
desperate to have us look at the good side of the racist police officer.
It felt a little desperate. Also, why have the robber get shot by the
good cop? Anyways, I did like the prelude to the first robbery scene.
