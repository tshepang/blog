As was with his previous [Breaking the Waves], Lars von Trier, the
director, also here lets his character go through much suffering, though
not portrayed in as painful a manner. This is helped by the enjoyable
musical moments, made all the better by the supreme voice and
compositions of Bj√∂rk, who also plays that unlucky heroine.

The relationship this protagonist of ours has with the prison guard is
quite touching. This is helped a lot by the portrayal of that guard, by
[Siobhan Fallon], who gives my most favorite performance of the movie.
