There is a Debian [history discussion] among Debian old-timers where a
point was raised that [Ian Murdock], Debian founder, successfully
transferred project leadership to someone else, a fact that [Bdale
Garbee] stated to not yet have taken place with Linux, the poster child
of FLOSS. It\'s also interesting to see Murdock praise successive
leadership as superior to his.
