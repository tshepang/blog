Exposing the shit life of being an illegal immigrant (and the associated
poverty, where people go as far as selling own body parts). I watched
this due to the appearance of Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays the lead
character. The character development is pretty good (check the friend
that works at the morgue, or the guy infected by some sexually
transmitted disease).
