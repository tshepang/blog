The documentary style has been employed elsewhere before, but there's
nothing quite like *District 9* in all movie history. Its weird and
wonderful story starts off with nice comic touches and transitions into
a harrowing tale of human torture, and ends as some action-adventure of
sorts, complete with superb visual effects, with some nice creature
ideas.
Sure there's warts here and there (I could not stand the resilience of
the villain, and I found the gang leader ridiculous), but to have a gem like this
emerge from my country of residence, South Africa, is quite something.
It is the best movie based there. The lead performance also deserves
applaud.
