This displeasing movie is so ridiculous that it would have been salvaged
by having the twist being that the guy was just hallucinating all the
time, especially since it was hinted that house arrest makes people go
crazy. Fuck, what's up with the supposedly hot gal? What the hell was
the respectable Carrie-Anne Moss doing here?
