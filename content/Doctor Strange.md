Am not a fan of highly complicated action sequences, though luckily they
weren't too long or loud in here. I also enjoyed the title character
before being transformed into a sorcerer, reminding be of the excellent
Dr House (the tv series), and also given a good performance. I did,
however, found his transformation of into a great sorcerer rushed. The
bargaining scene was interesting, though I wish the set was a lot less
cartoonish. There were some other stupid things, like the sorcerers
running around chasing each other, when they had the powers to control
objects by mere willpower, one of those "why the fuck didn't you do
that in the first place". I wish the black shit on the faces of the
evil sorcerers should have been explained as well... it looks so
stupid, like kids playing with mud.
