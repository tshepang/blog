One of those movies which choose not to distinguish themselves at all in
terms of story (so shallow, though I do like the vampire re-imagining)
and direction (nothing new), but it is entertaining at least. It also
got great visual effects and amazing make-up work, not to mention a
wonderful performance from the great [Charles Dance].
