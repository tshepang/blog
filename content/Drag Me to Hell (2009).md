If we ignore certain arbitrary and stupid happenings, this movie is
quite well-made and has some decent dialog. It also feels fresh,
especially in the first half. It's also the scariest movie I've seen
in a few years (if memory serves well), even though some of the scares
use tired techniques like loud sounds and sudden appearances of scary
figures.

I wish the lead could have been chosen for her talent instead of her
cuteness level.
