Exciting ride, all until the too-implausible elimination of the villain.
Could have been better if the humans lost actually, instead of the lazy
resolution, where the two heroes receive way too much pounding. The
enemy was also too advanced (faster, bigger, and better weaponry) for
them to make through that final showdown. Everywhere else if fine,
because the two heroes get multiple opportunities against this
impressive enemy. I also wish the enemy was explored more. The
single-super-villain-controls-all-others thing is just too stupid and
recycled (think *Independence Day*). and not worthy of a quality
offering such as this gem. Not even Tom Cruise is a blemish, and the
visual effects are supreme, even though they were showcased mainly at
the beginning.
