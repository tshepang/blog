It is an entertaining movie, but lacks a well-developed story and
characters. Not even the acting is satisfactory, bar that of Matt Damon
(lead character) and [William Fichtner] (his boss). The actions of the
violent villains are not justified, and so are those of the Jodie Foster
villain. The leader of the revolutionry criminals is very unconvincing.
The movie also feels rushed. It\'s a pity because it starts well, and is
well-made (the director made [District 9] after all), complete with
great visual effects and action direction.
