The lead gives an amazing and charming performance. James Gandolfino is
impressive too, and they are both very believable. The direction and
editing are wonderful, all so smooth and out of the way, focusing very
much on the characters. It's all blessed with an amazing script, a
rather unusual story (fresh), quality humor, and one of the best
on-a-date moments in movie memory.

The issue with it is that the second half doesn't feel as solid as the
first, and the whole thing doesn't feel like it has good re-watch
value. It feels more like (a really good) TV series, something like
*Girls*.

It was an interesting discovery that the director responsible for this
one (Nicole Holofcener) also made two other movies I love: *Friends With
Money* and [Please Give]. For that reason, they deserve a revisit, more
so than this one :)
