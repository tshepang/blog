I very much enjoyed listening to this album, which also happens to be
the first by the group, [Wu-Tang Clan]. My favorite tracks:

1.  track 04: **Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber**; also redone (track 12)
2.  track 09: **Method Man** - me loving the playfulness; also redone
    (track 13)
3.  track 07: **Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit** - some more
    playfulness
