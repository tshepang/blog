Fascinating, with an eery feel that's accentuated by the overly loud
and uncomfortable score, it also possesses wonderful direction and
dialog. Performances are also good, most impressive of which is the
lead, though [Sonoya Mizuno], playing food/sex servant, offered the most
pleasure to the eye, especially when dancing. She's so perfect.
