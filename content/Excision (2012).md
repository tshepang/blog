There is [a good review] about this, a movie that starts with more
promise than it delivers. The imagery is provocative, but not really
shocking. The movie done and written quite well, complete with quality
performances, my favorite of which is that of the lead. She's also damn
beautiful, though nearly as much as the gal across the street... wow!
The ending is a let-down... too unrealistic.

I liked this bit in [another quality review], which will become relevant
once you are done watching:
