Following are tools I use a lot, but am not necessarily loving (There is
[a separate post] for those).

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Debian**: my primary OS, and also my favorite

-   **wajig**: [I used to maintain it]
-   **APT**: a collection of Debian package management tools

software development

-   **Emacs**: I also use it as a general purpose text editor
-   **Git**: as if I had a choice... work and open source
-   **Mercurial**: slight preference of Git
-   **Rust**: primary language, and a great favorite

work

-   Docker: a central component of our infranstructure
-   systemd: journalctl & sysmtemctl

entertainment

-   **Quod Libet**: audio player that comes with a very excellent tag
    editor, **Ex Falso**
-   **VLC**: user interface could be a lot better

GUI applications

-   **Xfce Terminal**
-   **Firefox**
-   [Transmission][]: the only torrent client I have ever used
-   **Nautilus**: decent GUI file manager

miscellaneous tools

-   [dwm]: simple and clean window management
-   [tmux][]: amazingly powerful, but I wish it had less rendering bugs
-   **head** and **tail**: included in GNU coreutils suite of tools
-   [less][]: indispensable!
-   **OpenSSH**: duh!
-   [Fabric][]: I use it to build and deploy my blogs... it's some
    sort of replacement for shell scripting
-   [youtube-dl][]: I prefer watching videos locally, with VLC
