In which I am hoping that [FLOSS] would supplant proprietary
alternatives:

-   **3D content creation**: [Blender] should be mainstream\... used in
    blockbusters
-   **image manipulation**: [GIMP] should acquire feature-parity with
    Photoshop, and then steal the market
-   **DBMS**: [PostgreSQL] should acquire feature-parity with Oracle,
    and then steal the market
-   **Operating system**: [Debian] should be THE reference platform for
    various user types (large corporations, audio/video professionals,
    software developers, gamers, etc.), taking the market away from
    macOS and Windows
-   **scientific computing**: [NumPy] and [pandas] should acquire
    feature-parity with MATLAB, and then steal the market
