The painful story of *Festen* was powerful enough to have me label it a
masterpiece. Unfortunately that honor didn't survive a revisit. I still
consider it very well-made (only a master-director can make such a
movie, given its [self-imposed limits]), and the emotions it stirs are
still high-impact, and the story is important enough that I'd promote
it heavily if I had the means.

[**sidenote**] The very first scene is intensely horrid, one where
super-asshole chases wife and kids outta the car. It was hard to
swallow.
