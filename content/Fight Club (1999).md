What would one say when reviewing what one considers superior to all
other works of its kind? Following is a (lackluster) attempt.

The movie remains engaging after all these years and repeat viewings
(maybe 10 times). If feels modern as any movie made today, all except
for the lack of cellphones, and a presence of a CRT television set.

It's not perfect, and I wish to see something to dethrone it. Here's
what I don't like:

-   Tyler Durden manages to stand up after a bullet makes it through his
    throat. He can even talk normal, and gives a comfortable hug.
-   The beating the lead character gets near the end feels so needless,
    and it's not even interesting, to make up for its uselessness.
-   My least favorite moment is when the lead gives himself a beating in
    front of his boss. Boring.

I like everything else, and no movie has superior direction, production
design, and cinematography. The cast is great too and so is the editing.

Here's an old review:
