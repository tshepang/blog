I find it daring to have Denzel Washington play a character this broken.
Not evil, just broken. I don't know what was the point of drug addict
lover; maybe it was added in order to have the viewers sympathize with
this Washington character (he cared for her even though she was also
broken), but his saving of lives already put him in our favor. No, she
wasn't needed, at all, but she was welcome.

High quality direction, performances, and dialog; an unusual and rather
unpredictable story; an unneeded, but colorful, character (John
Goodman); an exciting airplane incident; a very fitting ending.
