If you can get past the boring setting, you will find an unusual and
entertaining story of a lady that is too stupid to realise that she
can't sing. It is also filled with decent performances, but the one
that makes the whole thing worthy of existence is that of [Simon
Helberg], who is embarrassed by being the pianist for the singer. He's
flawless!
