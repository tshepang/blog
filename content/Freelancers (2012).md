My brother trashed this one, so I watched anticipating the badness, but
it just didn't come. Sure 50 Cent (playing Jonas) struggles to speak,
but I thought he is a formiddable figure enough to forgive the lack of
talent. The rest of the performances are pretty good, but I'm tired of
watching the no-longer-interesting Robert De Niro. The character
development is also of good quality, and was best expressed when Jonas'
friends were shown around on their first day at work. The movie did feel
rushed though, and I was actually hungry for more of the racist guy. The
direction is very edgy, keeping me tense for a large portion of the
movie. The storyline is also unusual, and the middle-aged lady totally
edible.
