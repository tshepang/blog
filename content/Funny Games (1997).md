The lady playing wife gives an amazing performance, most visible in the
moments of mental torment and physical exhaustion. She\'s also so damn
pretty, her and the rest of her family. Another good performance is the
almost comic one by the lead perpetrator, whose few moments of talking
with the audience (us) represent a rather daring directorial choice,
given the seriousness of the situation. It\'s also a very welcome
choice. The direction is excellent: see how the aftermath of a great
loss is done, and see how touching the love between husband and wife is.
The pacing is slow at times without being boring for a moment.
