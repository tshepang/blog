It has good direction and acting (I've never seen Tom Wilkinson this
good, and I enjoyed watching the ultra-cool Omar Sy). But, it's yet
another example of a well-made movie that ends not so well. It's too
smart and fresh for such improbable things to happen, worst of which was
having the detective drive into a bad guy just-in-time. Regardless, the
critics gave it more hate than it deserved.
