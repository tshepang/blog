I didn\'t expect much from this one because I watched the trailer, which
exposed uninteresting visual and character design and a weak lead actor.
The movie turned out even worse than I expected, with an unbearably bad
and ludicrous story. Not even the visual effects help, because none of
them are any good. How can everything in the movie suck so bad!

Okay, the ugly guy who was to train the lead was a little interesting,
even though the character is recycled. The concept of a device that
allows one to create temporary matter-energy simply by willpower is kool
too.
