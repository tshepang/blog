Would be kinda nice to be caught in an eternal day. Imagine all the
stuff you can learn, and all the experiences you can have. All the risky
things you'd do, and all the impact you can have on people. That's
what the lead character does, and he goes as far as committing suicde a
few times, only to wake up the next day, and the next day.

The movie is done well, but has not aged too well. Would be nice to see
a remake of one of the most interesting movie concepts ever.
