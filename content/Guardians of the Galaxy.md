The most interesting performances:

-   Michael Rooker, playing Yondu, the leader of the bandits
-   Chris Pratt, playing the playful lead
-   Bautista, playing Drax, the heavily-tattooed brute (amazing make-up)

I also enjoyed Groot, the tree-like humanoid.

My favorite character design is the lead villain, though I wish the mud
on the face was explained. I also wish he was a more convincing
villain\... he needed deeper development than what he gets.

The whole thing is a lot more whacky than I expected, and does not suit
its epic name. It has lots of humor, and is very entertaining, but I
wish it was less of a passive movie. It also doesn\'t offer anything
new, and the visual effects are merely decent\... nothing
ground-breaking here.
