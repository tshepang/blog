I could not spot a real improvement from Halo 2, bar the hyper-realistic
environments of Flood-infested walls, the addition of some vehicles, and
the ability to dislodge heavy guns. It seems most effort went into just
the environments while ignoring gameplay and a fresh and good storyline.
It\'s quite a pity because the first Halo was such an epic achievement,
while the second, while unable to replicate the first\'s grandeur, had
quite a few innovations.
