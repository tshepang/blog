Possibly the most violent movie I've yet seen, this is made in the
style of video game first person shooters. I enjoyed the wonderful
performances: the villain was especially menacing, and the guide, given
multiple characters, was given an excellent performance by [Sharlto
Copley], in what is his most satisfying work since [District 9]. The
story is also fascinating and so is the technology.
