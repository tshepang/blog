Two things I enjoyed most:

-   the performance of the guy playing step-father of Harry Potter; it
    was however a recycled caricature
-   the chess game, which had great character design and animation;
    it\'s a pity it was mixed with substandard editing, with shots
    repeatedly cutting to the kids; also, the kids didn\'t fit well in a
    sequence so scary

Most anything else is just standard, which is the sort of thing that
made it mysterious to me why the book/movie series has had such
spectacular success.
