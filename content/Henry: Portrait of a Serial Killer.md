A very enjoyable story with some very interesting performances, most
notably that of [Tom Towles], who plays a rather disgusting character,
Otis. AFAIR, this is the only one of his performances I ever enjoyed,
and he's just perfect. [Michael Rooker] is also a joy to watch, and
despite his incredible cruelty, remains a guy we all care for, perhaps
due to his care for the (delightful) leading lady.
