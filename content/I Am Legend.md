It offers among the most impressive sets in movie history: a Manhattan
so deserted that lions and impalas walk its streets. The city is also
filled with rusting vehicles, including military tanks and planes. Too
kool.

Emma Thompson, though appearing briefly, does offer the movie's most
electrifying performance. Will Smith, on the other hand, shows a great
lack of acting skills, and is even embarrassing at times. He is,
however, interesting enough to lead the story well.
