Good quality but stale tale of forbidden romance. It has decent acting
throughout, especially from Alba Rohrwacher, who plays the lesbian
daughter. Tilda Swinton is quite good too, except that she overdows her
role a little too much (e.g. her restlessness is over-the-top). This
makes her portrayal rather unbelievable, even though she is a pleasure
to watch (as usual).
