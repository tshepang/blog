Following is some of the cases where competing software won this or that
battle, and I am jealous since I want everyone to use what I like:

-   [Kurbenetes] is written in Go, and not Rust. It appears to be the
    most popular container orchestration system, and is among the
    hottest of new software projects, while having lots of momentum.
-   [Grafana] is also written in Go, and not Rust. It produces the most
    pretty graphs I've seen yet, and is very featureful, while also boasting
    hundreds of contributers.
-   Markdown is a far more popular light-weight markup language than the
    far more advanced [reStructuredText]. It's particularly sad when
    it's not used where it's needed most... documenting large
    projects ([example]).
