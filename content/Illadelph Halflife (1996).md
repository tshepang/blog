This is undoubtedly the best album by [The Roots], and includes timeless
acts like:

-   *Section*
-   *Wot They Do*
-   *Respond/React*
-   *Push Up Ya Lighter*
-   *No Alibi*
-   *Ital (The Universal Side)*

Listening to *Section* is actually what prompted me to write this post,
for I loved it so much that I wondered if *Next Movement* (from their
later \[Things Fall Apart album\]\[\]), which I have for a long time
regarded as the best hip-hop track ever, deserves it\'s position at the
top of the group\'s work, and therefore removing it from the list of
[hip-hop landmarks].
