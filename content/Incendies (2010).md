A very rough twist/revelation happens near the end, and that alone makes
the whole movie worthy. It's also well-made, well-written, and got
decent acting, my favorite being the lady that plays the twin daughter.
It is also one of those rare movies that let a tear escape from my
eyes... the bus deception incident.

The movie took things a little far by having this mother be an assassin.
Also, her old age make-up could be better.
