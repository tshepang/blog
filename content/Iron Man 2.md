When the movie does not take shortcuts with the story (the villain is
too skilled in science/engineering and also too strong; the Don Cheadle
character was able to use the suit without training), or being
annoyingly-stupid (why the fuck did Pepper Potts drive with bodyguard to
deliver the suit), it gets the delightful direction and dialog of [its
predecessor]. The rivalry between Stark and Hammer lots of fun to watch.
The villain is also fun to watch, even though his motivations were given
lazy treatment. All three are given very good performances.
