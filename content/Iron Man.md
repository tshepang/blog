The best superhero movie made so far, I was amazed it held its
entertainment value after a few revisits.

The good:

- The relaxed and superb performance of Robert Downey, Jr.
- The charming performance of Gwyneth Paltrow
- The unique performance of [Clark Gregg]
- The great designs of the Iron Man suit, and all related visual
  effects
- The laid-back humor (first scene being the best example)

The bad:

- None of the villains are any interesting
- I wish the main villain had a bit of practice before managing to use
  the giant suit with such competence
- The hero manages to fool his captors of what he's building for a
  long time, especially given that he's under camera surveillance
- He also survives way too much physical pounding

You'll wish the filmmakers would invest as much in plausibility and
common sense as in the gorgeous suits on display here.

I really hated these bad things on the first revisit, but they were easy
to overlook this time around... the good stuff managed to distract me well
enough.
