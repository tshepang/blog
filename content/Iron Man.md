The best superhero movie made so far, I was amazed it held its
entertainment value after a few revisits.

The good:

-   The relaxed and superb performance of Robert Downey, Jr.
-   The charming performance of Gwyneth Paltrow
-   The unique performance of [Clark Gregg]
-   The great designs of the Iron Man suit, and all related visual
    effects
-   The laid-back humor; the first scene is the best example

The bad:

-   None of the villains are any interesting
-   I wish the main villain had a bit of practice before managing to use
    the giant suit with such competence
-   The hero manages to fool his captors of what he's building for a
    long time, especially given that he's under camera surveillance
-   He also survives way too much physical pounding

You'll wish the filmmakers would invest as much in plausibility and
common sense as in the gorgeous suit on display here.

I really hated these bad things on the first revisit, but they were easy
to overlook this time around. The good stuff managed to distract me well
enough.
