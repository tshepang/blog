Horrible horror without much going for it, except that the clown is
quite interesting, given his humorous and sinister character (and
laughter). Why they made the lady so sexually suggestive is strange. Oh,
and the black guy, why do I smell Black activism? The (non)battle with
the giant spider is ludicrous. It's one of those things that make it
hard to believe that movie makers always watch their creations before
release. They could have done better with that spider, even in 1990. Oh,
and the whole thing is just left unexplained.
