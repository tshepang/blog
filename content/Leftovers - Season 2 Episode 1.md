Few tv episodes have left as much an impact on me as this bizarre one. I
was reeling from it for days after watching it first time, and I hardly
ever re-visit tv shows.

The performances are without flaw. My one favorite is that of they guy
playing the fireman. He delivers one of the most impressive performances
I\'ve seen yet. He\'s such a pleasure to watch. Equally irresistible is
the gal playing his daughter. The character development given these two
is amazing. Playing the mother is Regina King and what is the only one
her performances I\'ve really enjoyed.

There is a strange choice of events which don\'t serve the story in any
obvious way, but they add to the enjoyment, and are given excellent
direction:

-   The incident with the scientist taking water samples
-   The brief and quiet moment showing the girls in the car
-   The girls running naked
-   The prison confession
