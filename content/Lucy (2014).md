It's surprising to have a movie with A-list starts be this wacky. It's
exciting and feels fresh for the first 30 minutes or so, right up until
the moment the lead character, Lucy, gets the drugs removed from inside
her. The phone call to mommy was especially wonderful. The villain was
also very scary. Most of the rest is gibberish, bordering on stupid. By
the time the whole thing ends, I was tempted to call the move bad, but
there's still that first 30 minutes.

One other thing to praise was the WTF that Morgan Freeman expressed on
the first phone call to this Lucy character. I don't recall such a
level of wonderment in all of my movie-watching experience (but I have
shitty memory).

The story concept is similar to that of [Limitless], but with far less
restraint, and a much lesser script.
