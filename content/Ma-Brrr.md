Following are my experiences of a musical play currently seen at State
Theatre, Pretoria. It\'s about the life and career of Brenda Fassie, a
South African vocalist who was arguably the most popular artist in the
history of the country.

First viewing
=============

The first night was the best experience I\'ve so far had in my stage
play experience. It was electrifying and the audience agreed with me,
with a few goose-bumps here and there. It\'s amazing how
larger-than-life one person can be made. It brought me much appreciation
of South African art, that there\'s such a rich culture to export.

So what are some the elements that made me so excited, the first time
around:

-   lead performance: I gained new-found respect for Lesego Motsepe, who
    is famous for her long career in Isidingo, a soapie generally
    regarded as South Africa\'s best; the director even mentioned that
    someone stated that she wasn\'t LIKE Brenda, but rather, she WAS
    Brenda; the result of the voice training she went through was
    amazing, because she really sounded like her character
-   music: the compositions were remixed, and the live band bringing it
    alive rocked; I wish it would get recorded because some of it were
    improvements on the originals
-   dancers: though the dancing merely okay, their energy was tops,
    especially the guys, and the quality of the choreography also helped
-   costume design: what the dancers had to wear was mostly impressive,
    and often offered an accurate display of dressing styles through a
    bit of South Africa\'s past
-   backing vocalists: wonderful, notably the fat guy, who had a tiny
    moment to act, which was hilarious
-   extra emotion: well, Bongani Fassie, Brenda\'s son, pitched on stage
    unscheduled, and even joined the lead performer to sing \"Too Late
    for Mama\"
-   miscellaneous: a bunch of scenes and moments are too many to mention

The fact that this was opening night may have helped a lot, as well as
close to sold-out venue. Now, the shitty thing about stage is that such
moments can\'t be replicated, and even though it may have been recorded,
it\'s just not the same.

The revisit was something else. The attendance was really bad this time
around (a Thursday after Friday\'s opening night):

-   lead performance: she was probably tired and/or discouraged by the
    small and unresponsive crowd; she mostly didn\'t even try to sound
    like Brenda
-   music: there\'s wasn\'t a degradation, so kudos!
-   dancing: less energy, and that there were fallen beads on stage
    probably didn\'t help
-   costume design: same shit, so nothing to say here
-   backing vocalists: wonderful, but the fat guy was just reciting his
    words this time
-   extra emotion: well, the Bongani Fassie thing can\'t be replicated
-   miscellaneous: no surprises, nothing new worth mentioning

Third viewing
=============

I went to see this for the third time, this time on a Saturday, so the
audience was much bigger than last time, and the show was far better,
making me a little bit obsessed.

-   lead performance: she did better than last time, but maybe not as
    good as the first night
-   music: I recall enjoying the previous moments better, maybe because
    I got used to it
-   dancing: the energy seemed as high as the first time around, and I
    enjoyed it more (I really the super-cool guys at the jazz club)
-   costume design: same shit, so nothing to say here
-   backing vocalists: the nice fat guy was replaced by a less
    interesting one
-   extra emotion: I kept getting (unbearable) attention from one
    dancer, since I was on the front row seats; I guess she wanted to
    steal the show, and I didn\'t allow her (she was unrelenting) so I
    shifted my attention away
-   miscellaneous: the kids called up on stage were much more fun than
    on previous occasions
