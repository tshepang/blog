Good cinematography, production design, sound, and performance of the
lady playing Zinzi. Horrible old-age make-up (check mom of Mandela, or
worse still, check the Mandela face when Zinzi visits him in jail...
embarrassing and unwatchable). Also, I didn't see Mandela in the lead
performance (Idris Alba is not a very good performer, and is not
credible in the role).

The story was very rushed, and it leaves one feeling too many details
were left out (there was no mention of Oliver Tambo or Albert Luthuli,
for example), and some very significant moments merely given passing
attention (Sharpeville and Soweto killings, for example). One thing that
could have helped is narration, or even flashbacks. One can argue that
you can't fit everything in a single movie, but that would be an
excuse... I've seen biopics in which feel like they do justice to a
legend, recent examples being [The Iron Lady] and [Lincoln].
