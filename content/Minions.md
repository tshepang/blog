I never liked the Minions from the time they were introduced, so I
didn\'t expect to enjoy this, so it was a pleasant surprise to find this
movie better than the two previous ones. I thought it would be a tired
attempt at milking the franchise, but it turned out a good execution of
the concept of characters who derive purpose from serving villains.
Speaking of those, the lead villain is such a pleasure to watch,
together with the husband. Both are works of great character design and
animation. Their home is also a work of great visual design\... it looks
amazing. I wish it was explored more.
