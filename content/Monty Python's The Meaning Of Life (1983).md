Lots of excellent humor (*the machine that goes PING*, *welcome to the
middle of the movie*, *baby falling from pussy*, ...), perhaps even
funnier than [Life of Brian], though it was quite a surprise that it
resorted to vomit humor, and the most disgusting in memory.

This one was also disorganised as a whole movie, though not as much as
[Holy Grail].
