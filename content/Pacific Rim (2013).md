For a movie this expensive, I found none of the visual effects
impressive. Not even the designs, both creature and mechanical, deserve
applause. The battles were entertaining, but too erratic to keep track
of what\'s goin on. The story concept is retarded, making it a blatant
excuse to put giant robots on screen who didn\'t happen to be
*Transformers*. I also wish there was an explanation for the whole
thing, beyond the too-brief and nonsensical alien invasion story. Not
one performance was beyond average, nor was any of the humor effective.

So, is there anything to celebrate here? Well\... it\'s not boring.
