Very nice production and creature design, although both these elements
have been copied (inspired) from elsewhere. The whole thing is rather
disturbing though ([Ben Foster] is an intense actor; the sound effects
were extremely loud; the sounds made by the creatures didn't help
either). It's edge-of-your-seat stuff, with horrid enemies all over.
