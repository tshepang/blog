Another example of [The Case of 'The Matrix Reloaded'], this is how I
felt after the first viewing:

> ... happens to possess much sophistication (direction and dialogue)
> with some shocking imagery, including one which must have inspired
> [Fight Club] (a sort of obscenity which is surprising for a 60's
> movie). The movie also feels fresh, feeling like a modern
> psychological drama/thriller, and therefore not as tiring and awkward
> as those of its age, perhaps testimony of its director, Ingmar
> Bergman, who is among the most honored ever.

Watching it again, it's so strange that it feels like a different movie
altogether. I struggled to stay awake... it's boring as fuck. It's
also pointless. I must go find out what the fuss is all about.
