A friend asked me of my experience of this spectacle and I could only
say that, albeit having many good elements, it was underwhelming +++ a
nice summary actually.

The best thing in the entire trilogy was Davy Jones (as I have pointed
out [before]), and he was so perfect in his first appearance that he
couldn\'t be improved, and there is no new character introduced here
that is so appealing, nor any wow-factor element at all, denying the
movie any entry in the \[visual effects spectacle\]\[pointed\] and movie
of the year lists. Sure the centerpiece of the movie raises bars, but
I\'m no particular fan of sea-based action, so this ain\'t no visual
effects spectacle, but it\'s a satisfactory spectacle nonetheless, for
there\'s a smile on my face when thinking of it, and thinking of its
complexities and various treats (and especially the opening scene which
is a landmark in film history) \[[update: 03 Mar 2008]\].

I mentioned the complexities, possibly a deliberate attempt by movie
makers to have viewers give the movie a second look, for there\'s so
much plot, so many betrayals, so many surprises, some disappointments
(an annoying marriage; Chow Yun-Fat\'s appearance), amazing make-up and
costume work (nothing new in the trilogy though), proliferation of
colorful characters (too many, even for a movie so lengthy)\...

Pretty decent entertainment after all, but then I already saw
[Apocalypto], *Fearless*, and [300] so far this year, which still stand
to be beaten, though none have visual effects matching this pirates
movie, and I doubt there will be this year \[[update]\], which will
result in this being a reluctant winner in that department.
