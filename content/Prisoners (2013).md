Hugh Jackman gives his best performance I've seen, and none of the
others are lacking. The movie is also very well-made, and I could smell
the skill (and freshness) in the opening scenes, just before the girls
disappear. The rest of it remains interesting, despite the running
length of over 140 minutes. I would have preferred something shorter,
especially since the ending bits are not quite as impressive. The twist
was also a big let-down, with the (newly-revealed) villain unconvincing.
Also, some key plot points were left unexplained, or maybe I just missed
them. One example: why did the suspects keep quiet?
