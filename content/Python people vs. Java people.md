Now this is one heck of a controversial quote by the best computer
programming blogger in my memory:

> ...when you choose a language, you're also choosing a community. The
> programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't
> be as [smart] as the ones you could get to work on a project written
> in Python.
