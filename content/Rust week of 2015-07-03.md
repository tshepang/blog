-   I [made][] [a][] [bunch][] [of][] [some][] [rather][] [small][]
    [changes][] [to][] [the][] [Rust Reference], including [this bold
    one].
-   I made [another change], whose preparation forced me to learn more
    closure stuff than I cared for: **FnOnce**, **FnMut**, and **Fn**.
-   I added some [examples] of array usage to API docs
-   I also made [some improvements] to the RFC on coercions
-   Back to the Reference, I made two [additional][] [improvements].
