I enjoyed [Comparing Rust and Java], the first such comparison I
remember reading. It\'s also special in that the author hates none of
the two.

In terms of contributions, I am embarassed that I submitted a mere
[two][] [changes].

  [Comparing Rust and Java]: https://llogiq.github.io/2016/02/28/java-rust.html
  [two]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32028
  [changes]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32029
