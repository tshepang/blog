I struggled hard enough with a `does not live long enough` that I
decided to ask for help, and the [solution to my problem] was actually
quite simple.

I submitted [some][] [doc][] [fixes] to various projects, and reported
[an issue] that promptly fixed on yet another. [I also ran rustfmt] on
some part of Rust.
