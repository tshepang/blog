I been wanting to write a Rust reStructuredText parser for the longest
time, and surprised to find that [one has been around for months]. I do
not have the skills enough to build such a thing, so am glad someone
beat me to it.

In terms of contributions, there were [just][] [two] this week.

  [one has been around for months]: https://github.com/flying-sheep/rust-rst
  [just]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3357
  [two]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3358
