I enjoyed reading this post about bad C ideas that are seen in other
languages, including Rust. I talked a bit about it [on Twitter].

I finally did set up my Emacs for code completion ([init.el changes]),
thanks to [an easy guide]. I tried many months back and failed for some
reasons I do not remember.

Regarding contributions, I made [just one].
