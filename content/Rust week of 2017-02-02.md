I very much enjoyed reading about [the design of Rust futures]. It makes
me highly appreciate the smarts of those involved, and how lucky we are
to have people building excellent abstractions like such. In addition,
it also nicely summarises Rust traits. [I wrote a tiny bit about the
feature] myself some time ago.

I reported [one issue] and made [two][] [contributions].
