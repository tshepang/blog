Not much Rust this week, [just][] [three][] [contributions] of the same
thing. I could have made it one commit, but the repo was just too big to clone,
which is strange for a project this small.

  [just]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/pull/113
  [three]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/pull/114
  [contributions]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit/pull/115
