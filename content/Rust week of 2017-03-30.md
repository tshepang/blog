I very enjoyed reading [this (rather lengthy) comment] on a thread
discussing Rust CStr/Cstring APIs. It shows great depth of knowledge and
shows no fear of expressing strong opinions... I loves it. As for the
argument itself, I don't know enough to have a qualified opinion,
though the opposition is quite strong against the proposal (to deprecate
those APIs).
