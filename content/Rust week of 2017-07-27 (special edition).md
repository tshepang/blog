I been using this series to help push me into constant Rust activity,
ensuring I do not skip a week sitting idle. It worked in that, indeed,
no 7 days passed without a single contribution to the ecosystem, no
matter how tiny, and this has been going on for over a 100 weeks (i.e.
[since 2015-05-15], also Rust 1.0 release date).

The problem is I felt silly recording the tiny parts, stuff like a typo
fixes, just to keep this going. Well, it's time to stop that. I intend
to avoid recording such, and if it means no blog post for that week, so
be it.

*This was inspired by having a laptop failure, with a draft that wasn't
backed up anywhere. That draft only consisted of a list of those tiny
contributions, and it felt extra silly trying to recreate it for
publication.*
