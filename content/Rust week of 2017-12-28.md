Very little Rust last week, but this week I played some with [termion]
for some user interface on a private project. I borrowed some of the
code from [a project I mentioned previously], one where I used the
library for the first time. As was the case with that project, I found
handling of keyboard input tedious and non-intuitive, and imagine there
must be an easier way.

We had [another monthly meetup] (we've had several of them so far),
which was the usual random informal discussion of the exciting ecosystem
of the great language that is Rust.
