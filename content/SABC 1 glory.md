I got captivated by the new SABC 1 theme presentation (for lack of a
better name), which is a fusion of computer animation and live footage
with reddish filtering, an artistic impression reminding me of the
visual landmark that is 300. It\'s however not nearly as popular or
memorable as the previous theme which portrayed South African Black and
White people having switched roles (as in White people living in
townships and Black people leading a more affluent lifestyle). This, the
latter, is an interesting play on the stereotypical both races have on
each other and was notably also because of the superb camerawork and
some interesting acting. It\'s interesting as regards the former for I
thought the latter couldn\'t be bettered.
