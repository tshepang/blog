It is entertaining throughout its entire 140+ minute run-time, but it
feels like a desperate attempt to be trendy/stylish. See for example
going for the gorgeous Salma Hayek as lead villain, or the three-some
thing. Brutality is fine in movies (scary shit keeps me on
edge-of-seat), but the rape scene was just not needed. Anyways, this
isn't serious film-making.
