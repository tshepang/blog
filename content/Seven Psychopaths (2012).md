My favorite utterance from the movie:

> A hooker comes out of the bathroom in a beautiful red dress. She says,
> "Would you like to make love? Or, should we have an intelligent
> conversation instead? I've been reading a lot of Noam Chomsky lately;
> I think he's a marvel"

It is a very well-made dark comedy with some wonderful performances. My
favorites are [Tom Waits] and the Vietnamese psychopath. The latter also
happens to be the lucky guy who gets to experience some moments with
that one special hooker. I also loved the old lady in hospital, who also
happens to be gorgeous. Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, and Woody
Harrelson are impressive, but this is business-as-usual for them, so
nothing novel there.

Politically, the movie is important in that it does, in a rather subtle
way, condemn homophobia. It also promotes interracial romantic
relationships, which I always find beautiful.

[The earlier movie], written and directed by the same person, is a
superior work of art in many ways, though not as funny.
