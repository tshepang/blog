Robert Downey Jr. is a lot of fun to watch and so is Stephen Fry, who
plays the most interesting character in the movie. I also enjoyed [Jared
Harris], whose villain character offers superb rivalry with that of the
lead. It's my most favorite of his performances (though I wish his
character didn't sing). Also, I have never seen [Kelly Reilly] this
desirable. The visual effects are at time eye-popping (see the escape
from the military). It's fun watching Sherlock do his impossible
deductions.

Some tiny problems:

-   This may be a fantasy, but the action is too unrealistic.
-   Jude Law is not so interesting, and felt a bit miscast.
-   The gypsy sister kept hanging around seemingly without much purpose
    really, and the story involving her and her brother were not so
    interesting.

I enjoyed the movie a lot better than its predecessor, and it's even
better on a revisit.
