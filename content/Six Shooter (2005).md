This 27 minute short is worthy mainly due to the loud and fascinating
young guy sitting next to the lead character on a train trip. He happens
to be the most insensitive character I have seen anywhere (if my poor
memory serves me well), and is funny at times. The ending is strange
though, and I guess deliberately pointless.
