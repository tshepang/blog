This slightly reduces my fears of great social instability since it does
not look like the next 5 years will be better than the last 5. It could
even be worse, given we are said to be among [the most unequal countries
in terms of individual wealth]. There is no predicting the future, but
it does not look to me there is much hope, short of some miracles. That
the landscape of political power is practically left unchanged is
worrying.
