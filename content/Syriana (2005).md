Here is my initial review:

> Syriana is an uncompromising examination of government-sponsored
> corporate evil and an idiotic oil-rich monarchy that condones it, with
> a surprise ending. It's a minimalist, yet powerful, narrative.

A revisit proved not as impressive, and I don't remember what was
surprising about the ending. The quiet and distrinctive style of
direction gives it a fresh feel, although the quiet treatment tends to
make it boring in places.

Not all performances are interesting, especially the investigator with a
troubled housemate. I did not enjoy watching the middle-East kids
either.
