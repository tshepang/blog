Geoffrey Rush gives a very touching performance as kindly guardian of a
girl who lost her family. He is as loving a character as I\'ve seen in
movies. Emily Watson also shines as the angry wife. Both performances
are flawless, and the movie feels like a weird and horrid fable. It\'s
not a pleasant watch, especially the second half.
