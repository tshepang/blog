The most shocking thing about this overrated bore is that it was made by
Lee Daniels, the same guy who made [the most impressive movie made in
the last few years]. It's fucking weird! It's among the most
surprising things in all of my experiences watching movies. Not even a
wonderful actor like Forest Whitaker pulled off a decent performance.
He's embarrassing even, though not as much as Oprah Winfrey, who was
supposed to be a quality actor, given her *Color Purple* performance
(though I haven't seen that in over 10 years). Something must have gone
seriously wrong. Maybe it was a troubled production?

Anyways, it's not utter trash. I liked the concept of the heroic
activists being prepared for racist taunts, which was quite fresh. Not
that it was particularly well-made, but that it's just something I
haven't seen before in a movie. Another highlight is the character of
the younger brother of the activist at the dinner table, specifically
the *party* moment. It was beautiful. Sadly, not much else was. None of
the other performances were good (and I'm not exaggerating), and the
old-age make-up was even worse. Ridiculous!
