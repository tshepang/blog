I watched this only because of my great love for [its predecessor]. It
feels like a student effort, and is just not interesting, and therefore
challenged my perseverance a bit.

I did however like two of the characters, the criminals who want their
money back. The guys playing them give superb performances. One other
quality performance is that of company boss, while the best friend is
not so bad in parts.
