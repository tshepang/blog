Far better than its [immediate predecessor], and a worthy successor to
[the original], this is a well-made and well-acted thriller with a
well-written script. The twist is interesting, though not entirely
convincing... feels forced. I enjoyed the performances of the 2
detectives, though no one was as good as overweight plant-loving
character, a sort of wise guide for the lead character. The 'rape'
scene is superbly made.
