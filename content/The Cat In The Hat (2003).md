One of these days I'm simply going to have to admit the world's movie
critics are quite strange, and I really can't rely on them for what
they consider excellent. Take for example their thoughts on [*The Cat
in the Hat*]. This is because I find it really great family
entertainment. It's great fantasy and very funny, with great production
design.
