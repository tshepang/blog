The direction is very unusual, the performances are of high quality
(Brad Pitt is amazing, and so is Pen√©lope Cruz, not to mention the guy
that played Hitler in [Downfall]), and the story gets more edgy as it
progresses. I need to see it again to understand it better... it's
complex, and much of what's going on is only implied.
