I liked a few things:

-   I do not remember enjoying Antonio Banderas this much; his character
    and performance are superior to all others (not hard) in the movie.
-   I initially felt that Mel Gibson was miscast as villain, but he
    proved worthy: a fearsome personality (well-developed, and deserving
    a better movie) and a really good performance.
-   I enjoyed watching Dolph Lundgren; he gives a decent, humorous
    performance.
-   Jet Li and Arnold Schwarzenegger give awful performances, but it was
    interesting to see them play homosexual partners; I proud.

All other performances range from substandard to merely okay. They are
not interesting, and neither is the story. The movie is too loud, extra
shallow, and offers nothing new at all. I wish they don't make another,
because I'm gonna have to watch it as well :(
