I had to watch this one a few times in pieces because it was too boring
to bear. It\'s a sleep-inducing exercise, following an extremely
uninteresting semi-retarded lady who is suffering from an untold
incident, as well as the guilt of (potentially) hitting a human with her
car. We are led to keep hoping that something will actually happen, but
nothing does. Luckily the acting is good and so is direction and
camerawork.

\[**sidenote**\] There is one critic who [found it great], inspiring me
to give it a second look. It\'s a better and deeper review than mine.
