An unusual and somewhat dull movie which has the lead tell a the story
of his alien origins, a story so ridiculous it has people think is just
made-up as part of his entertainment set as a musician. This character
is played by a guy with an interesting face, a Jet Li lookalike, making
him a pleasure to eye. The other alien that later befriends him is fun
to watch, and the female police officer is pretty as fuck.
