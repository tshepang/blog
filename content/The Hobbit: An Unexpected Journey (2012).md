Smeagol/Gollum is among the legendary movie characters, and I felt he
was a welcome addition to the movie. He's as annoying as usual, but I
did like the faces he made during the game he played with the title
character, which I think were more varied/complex than he had in *The
Lord of the Rings* trilogy. I also enjoyed the character of the
eccentric animal-lover wizard. The trolls (ugly, disgusting giants)
represent great character design and so do the orcs, complete with their
wolves. Pity none of it is actually new. [I dislike the excessive
complexity of the battle scene]... serious waste of money and effort. I
also hate it when characters go through way too much physical pounding,
as in when the rock giants fight (a ridiculous and unexplained moment),
and the Dwarf escape.
