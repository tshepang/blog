I found the creature design of the dragon amazing; best dragon design
I\'ve yet seen. Most everything else is stale, though I do love the
giants. The combat moments were annoying, where you see puny creatures
stand their own against the fearsome beasts. I wish these beasts were
given more than cardboard characters, given that they clearly were
intelligent beings.
