I do not remember watching a more extreme movie, in terms of
(hard-to-watch) gore. The director also tried real hard to make the lead
character as repulsive as possible, a character lucky enough to get a
wonderful performance by [Laurence R. Harvey] (his first movie).
Interestingly, this character cannot be blamed for the harms he inflicts
on others, given he's mentally disturbed, complete with a rather
unhappy toddler-hood. It's a pity three of the other characters were
just lazily-developed, making them unconvincing:

-   Mommy was a cheap copy of the one in [Precious]. The story went too
    far by having her try to kill her own child, though the reaction of
    this child, the lead character, was super-kool... so damn oblivious
    to what just occurred. Did I mention I love this character?
-   The horny guy with a large beard should have been given more of a
    story. He is interesting, but his actions were just left
    unexplained... his sexual attraction to the lead character. It was
    also real stupid placing him near the workplace of this lead
    character.
-   The loud neighbor was too much of an ass-hole, going as far as
    assaulting the lead character for practically no reason. That was
    just stupid.

I though it was quite daring to include the pregnant woman among the
victims. Worse still, her giving birth like that. Wow! Talk of pushing
boundaries. Also, the movie may not be as fresh as its predecessor, but
it's a lot better (direction, cinematography, acting).
