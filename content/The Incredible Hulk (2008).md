1st review:

> The *Incredible Hulk* has got a great fight between Hulk and 'an
> abomination' and is far better than its shitty predecessor. The
> scenic (and abused) views of the massive Latin American slums are
> memorable.

2nd review:

> I found William Hurt unbearable, while Liv Tyler and Tim Roth didn't
> help much. Not even the battle of monsters, which itself did lose its
> appeal, saves the movie.
