For a movie that is almost entirely made of dialog, this is exciting.
It's also the first time I saw the [Tony Todd] play an ordinary
character, which he does very well.

I wish there would be more restraint: the overreaction by some of the
characters was ludicrous and felt forced, and the Jesus part even worse.
