After watching what felt like a waste of time, I was surprised to find
that [there were those who found it decent]. The villain is given a
laughably bad performance by [Vinnie Jones]. I don't remember any of
his work any good.

Some parts of the movie are decent:

-   the intrigue the lead character goes through as he unravels the
    mystery that is the serial killer
-   the lady our lead character tries to impress with his art
