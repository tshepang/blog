Superb direction ensures that we are kept on edge of seat for much of
the running length of the movie, and even the slow parts add to the
suspense. The lead detective is quite impressive, and I also enjoyed the
portrayal of the father of protagonist, as well as the (damn gorgeous)
wife of protagonist.

The movie opens with wonderful dialog, and the rest of it more than
lives up to the high standards that scene sets.

Special mention should go to the guy at the airport checkpoint. The
performance is amazing, though shortlived.
