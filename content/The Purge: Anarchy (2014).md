Intensely brutal story about a United States where, on one night of the
year, murder is made legal. It's a fresh idea, and is executed well,
though a bit over-the-top at times. It's also not a plausible idea, or
rather, it deserved better justification.

The performances are of decent quality, best of which are the rich
characters near the end, who view killing others as entertainment. My
favorite, though brief, is the leader of those who deliver the victims
to these rich killers: scary, yet somewhat sympathetic.
