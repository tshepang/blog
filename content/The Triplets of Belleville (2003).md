And here's what I wrote in 2010:

On a third viewing, it feels more a curious experiment than a serious
movie, and it remains as unusual as ever. I love the mother (her resolve
is impressive), but the title characters are even more interesting. The
dog, dumb as it is, is lovable. There is not much going on in the movie,
and if fact, what is supposed to be a climax is just a string of
fantasy-like quirky moments. By the way, I should have said *practically
no dialog*. There is a bit, but no more than two or three sentences.
