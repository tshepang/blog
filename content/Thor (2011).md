Does not live up to the hype, some parts of the shallow story are
embarrassing, and the humor is recycled. The visual effects are meh, and
so is the costume design of the Asgards. Their city has a nice design
though, excessive as it is.

The title character is gorgeous as fuck. I also like the concept of the
mysterious gatekeeper, and the character. The silver robot is also
interesting.

I enjoyed the movie more on a revisit.
