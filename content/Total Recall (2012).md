The movie is so different from the first same-titled one from 1990 such
that it cannot really be called a remake. It is not quite as
interesting, and so are the lead actors (there is no Schwarzenegger or
Sharon Stone), does not take place in Mars (sadly) and is a
straight-forward thriller without any mind-fuck qualities the first one
had. The action was really overlong, and had the too-many hero-luck
moments, making it nearly unbearable towards the end.

Some nice technology ideas I have not seen before:

-   Necklace that allows one to change appearance; by the way, the guy
    the protagonist turns into gives a nice performance.
-   Transport that goes through center of the planet straight to the
    other side.
-   Small video cameras that attach themselves to surfaces, shot through
    a gun.

And some I have seen:

-   levitating cars (a few movies)
-   a machine that gives one convincing but fake memories (the first
    *Total Recall*)
