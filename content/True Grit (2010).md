Quality dialog throughout and decent acting. Some big names are
involved, but it's interesting that they stayed away from expensive
gloss, and instead focused on the simple story of *we gotta find this
killer*.

[**sidenote**] One critic [complained] ([via]) about Jeff Bridge's
self-indulgent performance, and I totally agree. The guy is a fine
actor, but he really was getting too comfortable. I would not go as far
as saying the performance was any bad at all, as the critic claims. It
seems he disliked it so much that he decided to go all irrational on us.
It was probably just a lashback against the overwhelming (undeserving)
acclaim the movie got.
