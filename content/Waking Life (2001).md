Of all the (multiple) conversations the lead character has, my most
favorite is the one with the lady with red hair. This lead, largely a
passive listener, engages a more than usual, while also introspecting
self the most. One other scene I enjoyed is that involving a group of
four friends, who do a lot of negative talk, which is so deliberate it
feels rehearsed. Most of the conversations are nonsensical, which can be
challenging to my patience. It's an interesting, and strange movie.
