The two toughest guys, the brother and the Russian guy, are scary as
fuck. The military back-story felt a little tired, and if anything, just
made the movie longer. It was done quite well though, so am not
complaining (much).

The teacher guy gives a very nice performance, and so is the wife. Nick
Nolte (the father character) does the usual, boring, business-as-usual
performance.

The conclusion feels far-fetched, with the predictable-ness that is all
too common in sports movies, but the entire thing is very well-made and
has real nice fight choreography.
