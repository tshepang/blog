This somewhat experimental work chronicles the suffering and thoughts of
an intellectual giant during an intense cancer treatment that lasts
several months. The performance of Emma Thompson is incredible, and the
best she ever gave. There is not a lot going on, but there isn't a
boring moment. Beyond the lead character, others are
highly-well-development, most especially the lead, the young doctor, and
the nurse in charge... what an angel.

The movie is important in highlighting the cold treatment one could
experience in health care facilities. This happens most in the early
moments of the movie, and even feels exaggerated, especially given the
prestige of the clinic.
