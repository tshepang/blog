I remember loving the first scene, in which some teleporting character
manages to infiltrate the White House. That, by the way, is my most
favorite of characters in the movie, followed by the gorgeous mutant
with the same powers as Wolverine. It is a pity she dies like that. I
also loved Mystique, whose abilities are ridiculously impressive. There
are so many characters, and the movie handles them really well, which
reminds me pretty much of [The Avengers]. Like that movie, you don't
feel like any character is left under-explored.

One other thing is the movie is by far better than [the original], and
in many ways. That is a strange fact, especially given it's the same
director responsible. It is easily the best of the X-Men movies.
