By the far the most interesting performance is the lead. He pretty much
the only thing that carries the movie, for the story is rather juvenile
and so is the choreography. There are good moments though, but they all
seem to involve him in the scene, my favorite being when he confronts
the gangsters about an abduction.

The only other performance I enjoyed is that of the prostitute that
falls for him. A darker movie with the same character is [Zatoichi]
(2003).
