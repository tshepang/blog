There is a number of people I did fall in love with in the recent past (about 2 years),
listed in the chronology of feeling the admiration:

- [Cornel West], for being on the race to become US president, on a convincingly moral platform.
- [Jill Stein], for the same reason as West, only with a lot more electoral experience.
- [Briahna Joy Gray], for speaking strongly against immoral acts of US government as a journalist.
  She happens to have interviewed both West and Stein.
- [Aslı Bâli], for teaching me how the world works, her being a scholar of international law.
- [Rania Khalek], for teaching me about Syria.
  She happens to have been interviewed by Briahna Joy Gray.
- [Fadhel Kaboub], for campaigning on a proposal to reduce suffering of people in Africa.
  He also happens to have been interviewed by Briahna Joy Gray.
- [Mark Z. Jacobson], for showing that green technology (solar, wind, water)
  of today are all that is needed to urgently combat climate change.
