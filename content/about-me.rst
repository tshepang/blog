-  Gauteng province, `South Africa`__

I do software development `for a living`__ and as a hobby
(examples__). My favorite ecosystem (and language) is that of
Python__. My OS of choice is Debian__, I watch perhaps too many
movies__, and I `spend perhaps too much time on the web`__. I also
love music__, as well as engaging conversation.
