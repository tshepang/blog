Here's a part-fictional account of events that are largely my fault:

1.  Friend got a new laptop and I elect to install Debian (or whatever
    OS I find suitable at that moment) side-by-side with the
    pre-installed Windows.
2.  I show Friend around since he finds the interface unfamiliar, and I
    get a dry mouth explaining the advantages, while trying hard to
    avoid Windows bashing. He sort of agrees.
3.  I upgrade it later on (mainly because I'm hoping the new hotness
    will get their Wi-Fi hardware working).
4.  The upgrade breaks something else in the process, and I spend hours
    fixing it...
5.  Only to have them spend their computing lives in Windows since it's
    more familiar (as well as the fact the software that came with their
    cell-phone doesn't run anywhere else).
6.  We computer 'geniuses' all know that Windows has a nasty habit of
    overwriting the boot partition such that an already-installed OS is
    no longer bootable, so I gotta come over, to make it bootable again
    (and this is made worse by the fact that reinstalls are pretty
    commom when Windows gives trouble).
