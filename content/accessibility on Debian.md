[Accessibility] is one of those things we the privileged (those with
workable eyesight and hearing) tend to forget about; That's why
developers like Debian's Samuel Thibault deserve great respect. The guy
was brought to my attention by the great Raphael Hertzog through [one of
his all-important People Behind Debian series of interviews].

This is one of those things that make me wish I was rich... pay a bunch
of people interested in this kind of work to do it full-time.
