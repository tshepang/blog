In [Why I'm signing up for Gittip], a core CPython committer, Brett
Cannon, mentions a great reason to reward FLOSS contributors
financially:

> ... a way for the community to thank someone's family for letting
> them share their loved one with open source. For instance, tips for me
> would be a way of thanking my wife for letting me spend the hours I do
> contributing to Python in my various ways by letting me treat my wife
> to a night out so neither of us has to cook.

He inspired me to actually go find a bit more about this [Gittip] thing,
after which [I decided to participate] as well.

In terms of money, I previously fooled around with [flattr] too, but
stopped along the way for some reason (after a few months), so will see
how long this one relationship lasts.
