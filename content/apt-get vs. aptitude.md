Did I mention that [I love Stack Overflow]? It's a Q&A site for
anything that is related to computer programing, and the creators
(luckily) didn't just stop there. They went on to create a bunch of
other sites using the same technology and branding, covering other
topics (and they aggregate [the best new content] from those sites).

Enough with background info. What prompted this post is [the answer] to
the question, "[what's the difference between apt-get and
aptitude?]". This is from one of their sites, *Unix and Linux*, and the
answer is really thorough. Part of the question was "what the heck is
wajig" and I really liked how that part was handled as well. It serves
as a nice reminder of why the heck I'm working on [wajig] in the first
place... it rocks!
