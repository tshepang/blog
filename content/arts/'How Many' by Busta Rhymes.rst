'How Many' by Busta Rhymes
==========================

`Busta Rhymes`__ has a mixtape named *Cut Master C With Busta Rhymes*,
and in there is a version of **How Many Mics** from the album, `The
Score`__ (simply titled **How Many**).  Busta Rhymes is among the most
highly-skilled of all rappers, ever, but hardly ever performs in
supreme tracks, so I was excited to listen to his take on one of the
best hip-hop tracks ever (from `the best ever hip-hop album`__).
