[Busta Rhymes] has a mixtape named *Cut Master C With Busta Rhymes*, and
in there is a version of **How Many Mics** from the album, [The Score]
(simply titled **How Many**). Busta Rhymes is among the most
highly-skilled of all rappers, ever, but hardly ever performs in supreme
tracks, so I was excited to listen to his take on one of the best
hip-hop tracks ever (from one of [the best ever hip-hop albums]).
