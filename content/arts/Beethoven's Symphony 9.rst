Beethoven's Symphony 9
======================

I was led to listen to Beethoven's `critically-acclaimed`__ "Symphony
No.  9". Well, this may be because I'm a novice regarding Classical
music, but I didn't find anything amazing in there. Let's call it
acquired taste, but I've heard dozens of Classical tracks that were
superior. Let's say maybe I wasn't focusing much on the music (I was
listening to it while browsing the web). Oh, and I even played it
twice just to make sure, and still...  nothing.

**NOTE**: the version I listened to is formally titled *Symphony No.9
in D minor, Op.125 â€“ "Choral"* and was played by Wiener
Philharmoniker, Orchestra.
