Beethoven's Symphony 9
======================

I was led to listen to Beethoven's `critically-acclaimed`_ "Symphony No.
9". Well, let's say I'm a novice regarding Classical music, but I didn't
find anything amazing in there. Let's call it acquired taste, but I've
heard dozens of Classical tracks that were superior. Let's say maybe I
wasn't focusing much on the music (I was listening to it while browsing
the web). Oh, and I even played it twice just to make sure, and still...
nothing.

**NOTE**: the version I listened to is formally titled *Symphony No.9 in
D minor, Op.125 â€“ "Choral"* and was played by Wiener Philharmoniker,
Orchestra.
