BioShock
========

I enjoyed a `negative review of *BioShock*`_ partly because everything
else I've read so far was full of praise, and partly because BioShock,
immersive as it is, really is overrated. For one, I couldn't believe
that I was restricted to basically one environment, and I got so lost
around the repetitive-looking environment just as I was in Halo: Combat
Evolved (a superior game, especially considering it was released over 5
years earlier). This is not to say that BioShock ain't no good â€” it
remains excellent (an amazing array of genetic weapons; amazing art
direction; the fearsome Big Daddies; appealing gloomy storyline of
genetic engineering gone awry) and did alert me what a tremendously
useful tool 3D games could be as exploration tools to unfamiliar worlds
(even though I've lived through such an experience with the vastly
underrated Conflict: Desert Storm).
