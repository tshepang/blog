A very laid-back Burning Spear album, with a mere 9 short tracks, the
best of which is a re-imagining of one of my eternal favorite tracks of
all time, *Creation* (live versions). It\'s named *It\'s A Long Way
Around*, and I could not stop myself from repeating it.

Each of the other tracks is quite good, though not catchy at all.
