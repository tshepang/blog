I very much enjoyed listening to this album, which also happens to be
the first by the group, `Wu-Tang Clan`__. My favorite tracks:

#. track 04: **Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber**; also redone (track 12)
#. track 09: **Method Man** - me loving the playfulness; also redone (track 13)
#. track 07: **Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit** - some more playfulness
