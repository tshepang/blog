I love the smooth melody that is [\*Floetic\*] by Floetry. It is the
sort of sound you find in Jill Scott\'s near-masterpiece of an album,
*Who\'s Jill Scott*.

Here\'s my favorites:

1.  track 5: \"Getting Late\" -- not nearly as seductive as \"Say Yes\",
    but what it\'s a masterwork
2.  track 8: \"Say Yes\" -- it\'s most notable thing is the sensual play
    by one them gals; makes me wanna say\... yes
3.  track 2: \"Floetic\" -- energetic and nearly-formulaic; beautiful
    arrangements
