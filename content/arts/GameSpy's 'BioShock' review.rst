title: 'GameSpy\''s \''BioShock\'' review'
---

Last year, I got seduced by GameSpy with their [2006 review], and this
time around, I got seduced yet again by [their review of BioShock].
Going through their various categories, that game got mentioned more
than twice, being among the top10 PC games, winning Art Direction award,
and then, in what truly caught my attention, winning the Best Story
award. The review makes me salivate. \[[update]\]
