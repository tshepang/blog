I recently got hold of "Hold It Down" (1995) by `Das EFX`_. Real good
ole-style hip-hop, thanks to a friend who, when I asked who he reckoned
the best hip-hop group is, he mentioned Das EFX. In my investigations, I
also got hold of their "Generation EFX" (1998) which is really bad.
Strange that just 3 years later people can fuck up like that.

Here's my favorites:

1. track 18 – *Hardcore Rap Act*
2. track 12 – *Alright*
3. track 05 – *Real Hip Hop*
