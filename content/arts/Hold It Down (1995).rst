I recently got hold of \"Hold It Down\" (1995) by [Das EFX]. Real good
ole-style hip-hop, thanks to a friend who, when I asked who he reckoned
the best hip-hop group is, he mentioned Das EFX. In my investigations, I
also got hold of their \"Generation EFX\" (1998) which is really bad.
Strange that just 3 years later people can fuck up like that.

Here\'s my favorites:

1.  track 18 -- *Hardcore Rap Act*
2.  track 12 -- *Alright*
3.  track 05 -- *Real Hip Hop*
