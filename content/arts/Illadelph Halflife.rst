Illadelph Halflife (1996)

This is undoubtedly the best album by `The Roots`_, and includes
timeless acts like:

-  *Section*
-  *Wot They Do*
-  *Respond/React*
-  *Push Up Ya Lighter*
-  *No Alibi*
-  *Ital (The Universal Side)*

Listening to *Section* is actually what prompted me to write this post,
for I loved it so much that I wondered if *Next Movement* (from their
later [Things Fall Apart album][]), which I have for a long time
regarded as the best hip-hop track ever, deserves it's position at the
top of the group's work, and therefore removing it from the list of
`hip-hop landmarks`_.
