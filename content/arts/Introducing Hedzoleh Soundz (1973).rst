Several months ago, I bumped onto this jazz album by [Hugh Masekela]. It
sounds quite different to his more popular tracks, and although it has a
South African feel to it (Masekela is a citizen of that country), the
more dominating feel is from elsewhere in Africa (just don\'t ask me
where).

My favorites:

-   track 3: **Adade**
-   track 4: **Yei Baa Gbe Wolo**
-   track 6: **When**
-   track 7: **Nye Tamo Ame**
-   track 8: **Rekpete**
