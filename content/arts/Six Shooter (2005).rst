Six Shooter (2005)
==================

:date: 2013-02-24
:tags: good, short



This 27 minute short is worthy mainly due to the loud and fascinating
young guy sitting next to the lead character on a train trip. He happens
to be the most insensitive character I have seen anywhere (if my poor
memory serves me well), and is funny at times. The ending is strange
though, and I guess deliberately pointless.

I was inspired to watch this due the director, who later on made the
weird and wonderful `Seven Psychopaths`_.
