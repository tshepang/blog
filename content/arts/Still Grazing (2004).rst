Still Grazing (2004)

My favorites from this, the best album by Hugh Masekela:

#. track 2 - **Ha Lese Le Di Khanna**

   A remake of a track from Masekela's 1993 album, *Hope*. It's far
   superior to both the original and the second remake, found in the
   2001 compilation, *Grazing in the Grass: The Best of Hugh
   Masekela*. It's a masterpiece! I am tempted to call it the best of
   this musician.


#. track 6 - **Grazing In the Grass**

   It's perhaps not fair to place this old classic here since, if it
   was remade, doesn't sound any different from its form when it was
   first released in

#. track 5 - **Bajabula Bonke (The Healing Song)**

   Hugh Masekela must have really loved doing the vocals on this
   one. One could feel the passion. The song sadly doesn't end too
   well... the last minute or so is anti-climactic.

#. track 7 - **Gold**

   Not a very typical song, more like an experiment. Also quite
   sad... it's about economical exploitation.

The only let-down of a track in the whole 11 track album is the 10th, **Been
Such A Long Time Gone**. You wonder how it slipped in there. The 11th
track, **Stimela (Coal Train)**, is not the best version of this
beloved song. It's of mere decent quality. To be fair, it's also not
the worst.
