Too Long In Slavery
===================

The mood of *Too Long In Slavery* (performed by Culture, found in
*Greatest Hits - The Frontlne Years*) matches it's title pretty well
(the vocalist sounds like he's in pain and so is the melody). One
interesing is that, despite the pain, the whole thing is
near-comic/playful. It's beloved!
