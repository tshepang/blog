Too Long In Slavery
===================

The mood of `Too Long In Slavery`__
(performed by Culture__ and found in *Greatest Hits - The Frontlne Years*)
matches it's title pretty well
(the vocalist sounds like he's in pain and so is the melody).
The track still sounds is near-playful,
though it has nearly brought me to tears on a few occasions;
it's a powerful delivery of a painful message.
It's my favorite among the group's work.
