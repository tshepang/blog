I had developed a negative attitude towards Britney Spear's music due
bad quality (though to be fair, I haven't listened to much of her work,
all but the most popular few tracks). But there is one particular gem, *Toxic*,
and I was surprised to find that `it's critically acclaimed`_,
especially since I reduced it to a guilty pleasure.
