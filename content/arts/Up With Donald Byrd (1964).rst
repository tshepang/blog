Up With Donald Byrd (1964)
==========================

I thoroughly enjoyed Donarl Byrd's superb album, "Up With Donald Byrd",
most especially the masterpiece House of the Rising Sun and My Babe. I
have listened to a few the guy's albums and nothing quite comes close,
in fact some are so bad that it's strange it's the same artist.

Anyways, I went onto the interwebs looking for like-minded people and
found one who `disagreed`_, calling it forgettable. Either that's a
critic with a more sophisticated taste and much more listening
experience, or she's got twisted taste. I was actually surprised since
I'm even tempted to call this the best Jazz album yet!
