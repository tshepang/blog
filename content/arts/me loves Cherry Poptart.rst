This morning I read "Cherry Does the Time Warp", part of the funny and
politically satirical adult comic series, `Cherry`_. It's not the first
time I've read a Cherry installment, but this specific one parodies some
characters in history and popular media in a fun manner, but it's
highlight is Cherry's encounter with her teenage, sexually-inept mom
(and you can imagine what transpires).
