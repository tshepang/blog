title: 'the two versions of \''Water No Get Enemy\'''

[The first version of this song] was released in 1975 as part of the
album, *Expensive Shit*. It\'s among [the best works of Fela Kuti],
[himself the best musician in history]. It also has the special
significance of being a great favorite of [a great friend of mine].

Now what compelled to write this post is the version made by one son of
Fela Kuti, Femi Kuti. It was released in his not-so-good 2004 album,
*Africa Shine*. I enjoy it more, perhaps because I\'ve listened to way
too much of the original, resulting in it feeling a lot more fresh. It
has a faster pace, while being half as long (5 min). I love the lyrical
performance, the most distinctive thing about it as compared to the
original. I am sometimes tempted to call the whole thing superior, which
would not be accurate.
