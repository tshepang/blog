the two versions of 'Water No Get Enemy'
========================================

The first version of this song was released in 1975 as part of the
album, *Expensive Shit*. It's among `the best works of Fela Kuti`__,
`himself the best musician in history`__. It also has the special
significance of being a great favorite of `a great friend of mine`__.

Now what compelled to write this post is the version made by one son
of Fela Kuti, Femi Kuti. It was released in his not-so-good 2004
album, *Africa Shine*. I enjoy it more, perhaps because I've listened
to way too much of the original, resulting in it feeling a lot more
fresh. It has a faster pace, while being half as long (5 min). I love
the lyrical performance, and am sometimes tempted to call the whole
thing superior to the original.
