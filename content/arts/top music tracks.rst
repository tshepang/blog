All these are landmarks (i.e. beyond masterpiece level):

-   Bring Back My Yesterday (Barry White)
-   Confusion (Fela Kuti)
-   Crying Guitar (The Movers)
-   Diamante (Zucchero)
-   Django\'s Castle (Eddie Harris)
-   Do You Feel Like We Do (Peter Frampton)
-   Gauteng (Miriam Makeba)
-   Give Me (Burning Spear)
-   Igbe (Fela Kuti)
-   Jikijela (Letta Mbuli)
-   Lady (Fela Kuti)
-   My Love is Free (Double Exposure)
-   No Woman, No Cry (Bob Marley)
-   Old Marcus Garvey (Burning Spear)
-   Tomorrow is Forever (Dolly Parton)
-   With or Without You (U2)

This list is far from complete and notably won\'t include tracks from
Hip-Hop and House for they just don\'t fit, maybe as a matter of
prejudice, as in, \"how could I append KRS-One next to the mighty Fela
Kuti\", or maybe such genres are simply incomparable.
