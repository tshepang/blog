Although he made a lot of trash, Hugh Masekela remains one of the great
South African artists. After all we judge artists based on their best
works right? We are nice folk.

2 masterpieces
==============

-   Ha Lese Le Di Khanna (*Still Grazing* - 2004)
-   Stimela (*Hope* - 1993)

3 excellent works
=================

-   Grazing In the Grass (*Still Grazing* - 2004)
-   Bajabula Bonke (*Still Grazing* - 2004)
-   Yei Baa Gbe Wolo (*Introducing Hedzoleh Soundz* - 1973)
