Though not as enjoyable as I was hoping this revisit to be, Sharon Stone
is still quite a pleasure to watch. Michael Douglas isn't very
interesting nor is anyone else. The sexual energy was rather silly (did
we need to have near-rape in the story). Also, the movie isn't aging
well (check the 80's fashion for one).
