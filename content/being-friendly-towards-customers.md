I just a read [a very interesting post] on how to gain market share, and
what prompted me to post is the following snippet which states the
advantages of being friendly towards customers:

> ...It reminds me of independent booksellers, who said "why should I
> make it comfortable for people to read books in my store? I want them
> to buy the books!" And then one day Barnes and Nobles puts *couches*
> and *cafes* in the stores and practically *begged* people to read
> books in their store without buying them. Now you've got all these
> customers sitting in their stores for *hours* at a time, mittengrabben
> all the books with their filthy hands, and the probability that they
> find something they want to buy is linearly proportional to the amount
> of time they spend in the store, and even the dinkiest Barnes and
> Nobles superstore in Iowa City rakes in hundreds of dollars a *minute*
> while the independent booksellers are going out of business. Honey,
> Shakespeare and Company on Manhattan's Upper West Side did *not*
> close because Barnes and Nobles had cheaper prices, it closed because
> Barnes and Nobles had *more human beings in the building*.

I used to frequent some local book/magazine franchise whose merchandise
I liked but just couldn't afford. That made the experience
uncomfortable, the risk of being told to leave.
