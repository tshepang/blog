The *everywhere else* isn't exactly accurate, since I found the moments
before the lead leaves the house quite boring. Also, I didn't find the
lady *that* delicious this time around. It remains a special movie, and
kinda edgy, since you keep getting worried if anyone would actually
discover that our hero is actually a retard.
