Nicole Kidman is kick-ass and so is her acting +++ check the almost
unbearable intensity she portrays at some high-brow show (probably
opera) which she visits with her boyfriend. The script is damn amazing
too, and so is the camerawork, and this, a drama, is among the most
suspenseful movies I've ever seen.

A revisit rendered the movie a litle boring, but the performances and
great direction kept it interesting. The story also felt a lot more
silly. I can even understand why the movie was so heavily panned.
