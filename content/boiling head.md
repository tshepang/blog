Part of [an appeal] to not be offended on behalf of others:

> I mean, if he\'d replied to that hideous and obviously impractical
> macro with \"Go boil your head\", despite being something you could
> interpret as a command to greviously injure myself, I\'d have gotten a
> chuckle out of it and assumed he was being facetious. If anything,
> I\'d be more upset that he hadn\'t taken the opportunity to tell me to
> throw some vegetables in with my head when I boiled it to at least
> make a semi-decent \"pork\" broth.
