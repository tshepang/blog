It got the same sort of camerawork and set design (set about the same
time?) as [*An Education*], and it also happens to be a coming-of-age
story, only a lot less serious and a lot more of a fairy-tale. The
acting is decent, but Ralph Fiennes isn't convincing... more a
caricature than a shitty husband.

Trivia: I don't remember anyone mocking own father as the troubled kid
does here.
