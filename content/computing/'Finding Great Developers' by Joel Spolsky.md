title: '\''Finding Great Developers\'' by Joel Spolsky'
---

Reading [the article] today reinforced my view that Joel Spolsky is
among the best bloggers on the topic of software development. Here he
discusses a few strategies on finding excellent developers, and my
favorite moment is when he mentions how hard he spoils interns in NYC:

> They\'re met at the airport here by a uniformed limo driver who grabs
> their luggage and whisks them away to their hotel, probably the
> coolest hotel they\'ve ever seen in their life, right in the middle of
> the fashion district with models walking in and out at all hours and
> complicated bathroom fixtures that are probably a part of the
> permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art\...

The article is of course a lot deeper than that, and goes to show the
deep passion this guy has for excellence in the field.
