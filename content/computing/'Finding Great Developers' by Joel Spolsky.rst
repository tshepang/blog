'Finding Great Developers' by Joel Spolsky
==========================================

:date: 2012-04-03



Reading `the article`_ today reinforced my view that Joel Spolsky is
among the best bloggers on the topic of software development. Here he
discusses a few strategies on finding excellent developers, and my
favorite moment is when he mentions how hard he spoils interns in NYC:

    They're met at the airport here by a uniformed limo driver who grabs
    their luggage and whisks them away to their hotel, probably the
    coolest hotel they've ever seen in their life, right in the middle
    of the fashion district with models walking in and out at all hours
    and complicated bathroom fixtures that are probably a part of the
    permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art...

The article is of course a lot deeper than that, and goes to show the
deep passion this guy has for excellence in the field.
