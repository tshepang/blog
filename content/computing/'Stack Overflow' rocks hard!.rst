I can't believe that I only now discovered `Stack Overflow`_. It's an
excellent programming Q&A site which also happens to possess the best
user interface and design I've ever seen on the web (if memory serves
well). [**update**: this great design is shared by `other sites in the
family`_]

[**sidenote**] Within a few minutes of asking `some question`_,
I received a number of high-quality answers. It's amazing!
