Back in January 2007, I sent a patch that slightly improved the README
file found in the root directory of [Tracker], an exciting project that
is meant to be a data indexer (like [Google Desktop]) and much more.
This is what I consider the first ever FLOSS contribution I ever made. I
went on to make some minor code patches which also taught me a few
things, like [GTK+] and [GLib API].

  [GTK+]: http://developer.gnome.org/gtk2/stable/
  [GLib API]: http://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/
