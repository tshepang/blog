1st FLOSS patch contribution
============================

:date: 2007-04-03
:tags: GNOME, Tracker



Back in January 2007, I sent a patch that slightly improved the README
file found in the root directory of `Tracker`_, an exciting project that
is meant to be a data indexer (like `Google Desktop`_) and much more.
This is what I consider the first ever FLOSS contribution I ever made. I
went on to make some minor code patches which also taught me a few
things, like `GTK+`_ and `GLib API`_.
