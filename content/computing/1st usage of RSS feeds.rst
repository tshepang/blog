1st usage of RSS feeds
======================

:date: 2007-04-16



Browsing the ever-useful Debian's `planet`_ today led me to the usage
Google Reader. I've been ignoring this technology because I was too lazy
to figure it out and Google Reader makes it so easy, it does not require
me to think, the kind of property that is often found in any successful
end-user web technology.
