Asus Zenbook UX305F
===================

On 2015-12-14, I got me the UX305. It's the base level model in the
range, with 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD, an FHD screen, and Intel Core M
CPU (M-5Y10c). It it great value at R10k ($600 in USA), so it didn't
feel too much of an indulgence, given I still have the `Vaio Pro
13`__.

Like the older laptop, I had to change 2 lines in /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf::

  defaults.ctl.card 1
  defaults.pcm.card 1

What makes the Vaio Pro 13 better:

- The charger does not have a USB charging port

- The laptop is less pretty (so boring), and I'm not a fan of the
  purple look

- The power button is not a button, but one of the keys on the
  keyboard, which makes it too easy to press by mistake... happened to
  me a few times

- The ``Insert`` key is hidden behind the ``Fn`` key, which is
  awkward since I use the Ctrl+Shift+Insert combo to (middle-)paste

- The SD card slot is not full-depth, so you will see the SD card
  (adaptor) protrude from the side

- I'm used to the charging port being on the left

- No keyboard back-light

- The SSD is not as fast, and so is the CPU

Given all above, this is overall a better laptop:

- No (noisy) fan

- Gentle corners (though a bit too gentle, making this a less pretty
  laptop)

- Power consumption is very low, and I could easily get 8 hours of battery
  lifeon this thing with a moderate workload

- I loves the touchpad: it's more smooth and large

- The keyboard also feels a lot better; it's such pleasure to use!

- The body is also a lot more rigid, so no annoying flexibility at the
  bottom of the touchpad. The rigidity also ensures that there are no
  keyboard marks on the screen.
