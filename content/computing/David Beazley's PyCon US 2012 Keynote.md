[David Beazley\'s PyCon 2012 key note talk] is among the best I\'ve seen
in the field of software development. It\'s not even the content (the
complexity and hackability of PyPy), but rather the presentation itself.
The guy must have put a lot of effort in his slides, and what\'s better
is that he was also doing live demonstrations. From those, you could
gather that this isn\'t a mere mortal. He\'s brilliant (and humorous).
And I\'ve never even heard of him before, but he appears to be some sort
of legend in the Python community.
