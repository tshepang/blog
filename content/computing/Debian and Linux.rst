Debian and Linux
================

There is a Debian `history discussion`_ among Debian old-timers where
a point was raised that `Ian Murdock`_, Debian founder,
successfully transferred project leadership to someone else, a fact that
`Bdale Garbee`_ stated to not yet have taken place with Linux, the
poster child of FLOSS. It's also interesting to see Murdock praise
successive leadership as superior to his.
