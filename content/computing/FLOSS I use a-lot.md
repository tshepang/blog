Following are tools I use a lot, but am not necessarily loving. There is
[a separate post] for those.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Debian**: my primary OS, and also my favorite

-   **wajig**: [I also develop and maintain it]
-   **APT**: a collection of Debian package management tools

software development

-   **Emacs**: I also use it as a general purpose text editor
-   **Git**: as if I had a choice\... work and open source
-   **Mercurial**: my favorite
-   **Rust**: this has since replaced Python as my favorite language,
    and I spend far more time with it than any other

work

-   Docker: a central component of our infranstructure
-   systemd: journalctl & sysmtemctl

entertainment

-   **Quod Libet**: audio player that comes with a very excellent tag
    editor, **Ex Falso**
-   **VLC**: user interface could be a lot better

GUI applications

-   **Xfce Terminal**
-   **Firefox**
-   [Liferea][]: I like it, ugly and unkool as it is
-   [Transmission][]: the only torrent client I have ever used
-   **Nautilus**: decent GUI file manager

miscellaneous tools

-   [dwm]
-   [tmux][]: amazingly powerful, but I wish it had less rendering bugs
-   **head** and **tail**: included in GNU coreutils suite of tools
-   [less][]: indispensable!
-   **OpenSSH**: duh!
-   [autojump][]: makes navigating the filesystem a joy
-   [Fabric][]: I use it to build and deploy my blogs\... it\'s some
    sort of replacement for shell scripting
-   [youtube-dl][]: I prefer watching videos locally, with VLC
