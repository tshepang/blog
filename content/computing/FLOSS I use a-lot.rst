FLOSS I use a-lot
=================

:tags: list



Following are tools I use a lot, but am not necessarily loving.
There is `a separate post`__ for those.

**Debian**: my primary OS, and also my favorite

- **wajig**: `I also develop and maintain it`__
- **APT**: a collection of Debian package management tools

software development

- **Emacs**: I also use it as a general purpose text editor
- **git-cola**: `why me loves it`__
- **GNU toolchain** (GCC, make, GLibC, ...)
- **Git**: as if I had a choice... work and open source
- **Mercurial**: my favorite
- Meld__: the most excellent diff tool I've used yet
- **CPython**: I spend more time with Python as compared to any other
  programming language

entertainment

- **Quod Libet**: audio player that comes with a very excellent tag
  editor, **Ex Falso**
- **VLC**: user interface could be a lot better


GUI applications

- **Xfce Terminal**: nicer than my previous favorite, GNOME Terminal
- **Evince**: I would love to get a PDF reader with better navigation
- **Firefox**: not as pretty as my previous favorite, Chrome; but that
  it has a more trustworthy steward (Mozilla vs. Google), and
  it being less restrictive (Chrome makes it painful to install third
  party add-ons) makes it a winner
- **Gnumeric**: it's faster than LibreOffice spreadsheet, and has a
  superior search interface
- Liferea__: would not be using this had it not been for Google Reader
  shutdown, but am glad they did because I like this tool, ugly and unkool
  as it is
- **Thunderbird**: I prefer Evolution, but it gave me some issues last
  time I tried; I don't remember the details
- Transmission__: the only torrent client I have ever used
- **Nautilus**: decent GUI file manager
- **FileZilla**: I should really find something nicer for my SFTP needs
- `File Roller`__: nice and simple GUI archive manager

miscellaneous tools

- **dwm**: `replaced GNOME as my primary desktop environment`__
- tmux__: amazingly powerful, but I wish it had less rendering bugs
- **tail**: part of GNU coreutils; indispensable!
- less__: indispensable!
- **Minicom**: use this for some ancient setups at work, for some clients
- **OpenSSH**: duh!
- autojump__: makes navigating the filesystem a joy
- Fabric__: I use it to build and deploy my blogs... it's some sort of
  replacement for shell scripting
- VirtualBox: pretty much the only virtualisation tool I use;
  My use is extensive... I often leave a virtual machine running for days
