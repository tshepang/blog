software development

- **Emacs**: I also use it as a general purpose text editor
- **Git**: as if I had a choice... work and open source
- **Mercurial**: my favorite
- **Rust**: this has since replaced Python as my favorite language,
  and I spend far more time with it than any other


work

- Docker: a central component of our infranstructure
- systemd: journalctl & sysmtemctl


entertainment

- **Quod Libet**: audio player that comes with a very excellent tag
  editor, **Ex Falso**
- **VLC**: user interface could be a lot better


GUI applications

- **Xfce Terminal**
- **Firefox**
- Liferea__: I like it, ugly and unkool as it is
- Transmission__: the only torrent client I have ever used
- **Nautilus**: decent GUI file manager

miscellaneous tools

- dwm__
- tmux__: amazingly powerful, but I wish it had less rendering bugs
- **head** and **tail**: included in GNU coreutils suite of tools
- less__: indispensable!
- **OpenSSH**: duh!
- autojump__: makes navigating the filesystem a joy
- Fabric__: I use it to build and deploy my blogs... it's some sort of
  replacement for shell scripting
- youtube-dl__: I prefer watching videos locally, with VLC
