FLOSS I use a-lot
=================

:tags: list



Following are tools I use a lot, but am not necessarily loving.
There is `a separate post`__ for those.

**Debian**: my primary OS, and also my favorite

- **wajig**: `I also develop and maintain it`__
- **APT**: a collection of Debian package management tools
- **Aptitude**: I mainly use its ``search`` and ``show`` subcommands;
  the equivalent functionality in APT is lesser

editors

- **Emacs**: my favorite
- **Vim**: it happens to be installed on a lot of systems at work,
  and I do like it somewhat


software development

- **git-cola**: `why me loves it`__
- **GNU toolchain** (GCC, make, GLibC, ...)
- **Git**: as if I had a choice... work and open source
- **Mercurial**: my favorite
- Meld__: the most excellent diff tool I've used yet

entertainment

- **Quod Libet**: audio player that comes with a very excellent tag
  editor, **Ex Falso**
- **VLC**: ugly interface, solid application


applications

- **Xfce Terminal**: nicer than my previous favorite, GNOME Terminal
- **dwm**: `replaced GNOME as my primary desktop environment`__
- **Evince**: I would love to get a PDF reader with better navigation
- **Firefox**: I am not happy with its memory consumption, but have
  nevertheless settled on it
- **Gnumeric**: it's faster than LibreOffice spreadsheet, and has a
  superior search interface
- Liferea__: would not be using this had it not been for Google Reader
  shutdown, but am glad they did cuz I like the tool, ugly and unkool
  as it is
- **Thunderbird**: I prefer Evolution, but it gave me some issues I
  don't remember
- Transmission__: the only torrent client I have ever used
- Nautilus: favorite GUI file manager
- **FileZilla**: I should really find something nicer for my SFTP needs
