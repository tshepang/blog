Following are tools I use a lot, but am not necessarily loving.
For those I like a lot, see `this list`__.

__ http://tshepang.net/favorite-floss

* **Debian**: my primary OS, and also my favorite

  - **wajig**: `I also develop and maintain it`__
  - **APT**: a collection of Debian package management tools
  - **Aptitude**: I mainly use its ``search`` and ``show`` subcommands;
    the equivalent functionality in APT is lesser

* editors

  - **Emacs**: my favorite
  - **Vim**: it happens to be installed on a lot of systems at work,
    and I do like it somewhat

* software development

  - **git-cola**: `why me loves it`__
  - **GNU toolchain** (GCC, make, GLibC, ...)
  - **Git**: as if I had a choice... work and open source
  - **Mercurial**: my favorite
  - Meld__: the most excellent diff tool I've used yet

* entertainment

  - **Quod Libet**: audio player
  - **VLC**: ugly interface, solid application

* misc

  - dwm__: replaced GNOME as my primary desktop environment
  - **Evince**: I would love to get a PDF reader with better navigation
  - **Firefox**: I have since settled on this one, abandoning Google
    Chrome, the previous favorite
  - **Gnumeric**: it's faster than LibreOffice spreadsheet, and has
    superior search interface
  - Liferea__: would not be using this had it not been for Google Reader
    shutdown, but am glad they did cuz I like the tool, ugly and unkool
    as it is
  - **OpenSSH**: duh!
  - **Thunderbird**: I prefer Evolution, but it gave me some issues I
    don't remember
  - tmux__: amazingly powerul!
  - Transmission__: the only torrent client I ever used
  - less__: indispensable!
  - Nautilus: favorite GUI file manager
  - `File Roller`__: nice and simple GUI archive manager
