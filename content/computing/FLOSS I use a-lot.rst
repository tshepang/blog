FLOSS I use a-lot
=================

:tags: list



Following are tools I use a lot, but am not necessarily loving.
There is `a separate post`__ for those.

----

**Debian**: my primary OS, and also my favorite

- **wajig**: `I also develop and maintain it`__
- **APT**: a collection of Debian package management tools

software development

- **Emacs**: I also use it as a general purpose text editor
- **git-cola**: `why me loves it`__
- **GNU toolchain** (GCC, make, GLibC, ...)
- **Git**: as if I had a choice... work and open source
- **Mercurial**: my favorite
- **Rust**: this has since replaced Python as my favorite language,
  and spend far more time with it than any other

entertainment

- **Quod Libet**: audio player that comes with a very excellent tag
  editor, **Ex Falso**
- **VLC**: user interface could be a lot better


GUI applications

- **Xfce Terminal**
- **Firefox**: not as pretty as my previous favorite, Chrome; but that
  it has a more trustworthy steward (Mozilla vs. Google), and
  it being less restrictive (Chrome makes it painful to install third
  party add-ons) makes it a winner
- Liferea__: I like it,, ugly and unkool as it is
- **Thunderbird**: I prefer Evolution, but it gave me some issues last
  time I tried; I don't remember the details
- Transmission__: the only torrent client I have ever used
- **Nautilus**: decent GUI file manager
- **FileZilla**: I should really find something nicer for my SFTP needs
- `File Roller`__: nice and simple GUI archive manager

miscellaneous tools

- **dwm**: `replaced GNOME as my primary desktop environment`__
- tmux__: amazingly powerful, but I wish it had less rendering bugs
- **head** and **tail**: included in GNU coreutils suite of tools
- less__: indispensable!
- **Minicom**: I use this at work when I need a serial terminal
- **OpenSSH**: duh!
- autojump__: makes navigating the filesystem a joy
- Fabric__: I use it to build and deploy my blogs... it's some sort of
  replacement for shell scripting
- youtube-dl__: I prefer watching videos locally, with VLC
