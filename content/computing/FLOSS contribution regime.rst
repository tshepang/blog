FLOSS contribution regime
=========================

Late December last year, I had much time on my hands, given the holidays.
I also had, for a long time, this desire to understand web technologies.
There was even the sadness one feels for not contributing much to FLOSS.
That's when I started submitting some doc fixes and improvements to
Pyramid_, as well as other members of `Pylons project`_.
I kept at it for a number of days,
and the number of issues with the docs ensured that I didn't run out of
stuff do. At some point I decided that, if I can help it,
I should not let a day pass without submitting at least one patch,
and at another point, I thought, why don't I keep this regime for a
100 days in a row (inspiration_)?

Anyways, I am writing this post to celebrate my 100th day since starting
(`day 1`__, `day 100`__)! [#]_

How did this benefit me:

* I learned a much about Sphinx_ (doc build tool),
  as well as reStructuredText_ (markup format most commonly used in
  docs for Python projects).

* I learned a much about the `Pylons project`_, it's tools,
  and even got praise from its leaders.

What's next:

* There's still a few items on my TODO list, so I will not stop contributing.
* Next project I'm eyeing is liquidluck_, a the tool that generates this blog.
  It's a much smaller project, but I found its documentation wanting.
* Perhaps CPython may use my help too. Lots of code/doc bugs need fixing.


.. [#] Note that I didn't quite achive the 100-days-in-a-row thing;
   I skipped maybe 3 days, for one reason or another.
