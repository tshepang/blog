FLOSS pipe dreams
=================

:tags: Debian, Python, non-FLOSS


In which I am hoping that FLOSS_ would supplant proprietary
alternatives:

- **3D content creation**:
  Blender_ should be mainstream... used in blockbusters

- **image manipulation**:
  GIMP_ should acquire feature-parity with Photoshop, and then steal the market

- **DBMS**:
  PostgreSQL_ should acquire feature-parity with Oracle,
  and then steal the market

- **Operating system**:
  Debian_ should be THE reference platform for various user types
  (large corporations, audio/video professionals, software developers,
  gamers, etc.), taking the market away from macOS and Windows

- **scientific computing**:
  NumPy_ and pandas_ should acquire feature-parity with MATLAB,
  and then steal the market
