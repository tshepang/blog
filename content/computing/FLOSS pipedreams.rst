FLOSS pipe dreams
=================

:tags: GNOME, Debian, Python, non-FLOSS
:date: 2013-11-30


In which I am hoping that FLOSS_ would supplant proprietary
alternatives:

**3D content creation**:
Blender_ should be mainstream... used in blockbusters

**desktop**:
GNOME_ (or KDE_) should replace Mac OS X as THE desktop experience,
and then steal the market

**CRM/ERP**:
Tryton_ should acquire feature-parity with SAP, and then steal the market

**image manipulation**:
GIMP_ should acquire feature-parity with Photoshop, and then steal the market

**DBMS**:
PostgreSQL_ should acquire feature-parity with Oracle,
and then steal the market

**Operating system**:
Debian_ should be THE reference platform for various user types
(large corporations, audio/video professionals, software developers,
gamers, etc.), taking the market away from OS X and Windows

**scientific computing**:
NumPy_ and pandas_ should acquire feature-parity with MATLAB,
and then steal the market
