GNOME killer app

GNOME system monitor applet it is.

Many times when I'm thinking of using a different desktop suite, I know
that I'm not gon have an equal of GNOME's system monitor applet. In
Debian, this applet defaults to displaying CPU usage but can be set to
display more, including memory and hard disk usage. This is among the
things I add to the panel on every fresh install (for I always am
curious what's up with my system). Given how useful it is, I now wonder
why Debian doesn't add it on the panel by default, especially that many
new users won't even be aware it exists in the first place.

--------------

Clicking on that applet launches a more comprehensive system monitor
which has 4 tabs (notebooks in GTK+ speak):

-  a recently-added one that displays high-level system info (processor
   model, RAM capacity) which was a much-needed equivalent of Windows'
   own utility
-  one that shows mounted filesystems (pretty handy really)
-  one that displays live CPU, RAM, and network usage info, which
   recently (perhaps GNOME 2.22 released March this year) received a
   major facelift
-  and last and least, the one that got a process monitor that feels
   like a painfully stripped-down top (from procps)
