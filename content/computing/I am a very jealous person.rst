I am a very jealous person
==========================

:tags: Python, non-Python, non-Debian, VCS

Following is some of the cases where competing software won this or
that battle, and I am jealous since I want everyone to use what I
like:

* `I am jealous`__ that Discourse is written in Ruby, and not Python.
  I am also jealous that the official service runs on Ubuntu, and not
  Debian.

* `The pre-built DigitalOcean image that runs the
  (impressive-sounding) Ghost blogging system is built on Ubuntu`__,
  and not Debian.

* `Python 3 adoption still disappointing`__ - a mere blip compared to
  Python 2 as regards PyPI downloads

* Git (and GitHub) is so much more successful than Mercurial (and
  Bitbucket), my preferred VCS. Damn, even `the website looks
  better`__.

* Markdown is a far more popular light-weight markup language than
  the far more advanced reStructuredText.
  It's particularly sad when it's not used where it's needed
  most... documenting large projects (example__).
