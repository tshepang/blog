I am a very jealous person
==========================

:tags: Python, non-Python, non-Debian, VCS


Following is some of the cases where competing software won this or
that battle, and I am jealous since I want everyone to use what I
like:

* Git (and GitHub) is so much more successful than Mercurial (and
  Bitbucket), my preferred VCS. I mean even `the website looks
  better`__.

* Markdown is a far more popular light-weight markup language than
  the far more advanced reStructuredText__.
  It's particularly sad when it's not used where it's needed
  most... documenting large projects (example__).
