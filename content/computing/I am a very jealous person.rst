I am a very jealous person
==========================

:tags: Rust, non-Rust


Following is some of the cases where competing software won this or
that battle, and I am jealous since I want everyone to use what I
like:

* Kurbenetes__ is written in Go, and not Rust.
  It appears to be the most popular container orchestration system,
  and is among the hottest of new software projects,
  while having lots of momentum.

* Grafana__ is also written in Go, and not Rust.
  It produces the most pretty graphs I've seen yet,
  and is very featureful, and boasts hundreds of contributers.

* Markdown is a far more popular light-weight markup language than
  the far more advanced reStructuredText__.
  It's particularly sad when it's not used where it's needed
  most... documenting large projects (example__).
