I love the fact that whenever someone mentions a piece of software, I
can quickly do a `aptitude search piece-of-software` knowing that
there\'s a good chance that it\'s somewhere in the Debian repository.
That means I won\'t have to get to the website looking for a download
link, which, other than saving time, means I just have to deal with just
one interface as well as the confidence that `piece-of-software` is
well-integrated with Debian itself, given Debian\'s exacting quality
standards. Debian really is a gem!

\[**sidenote**\] The term, [supermarket], as used in this context, was
coined by some Debian Developer, although I mean it in a different and
more positive manner.
