Now this is one heck of a controversial quote by the best computer
programming blogger in my memory:

    ...when you choose a language, you're also choosing a community. The
    programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't
    be as `smart`_ as the ones you could get to work on a project
    written in Python.
