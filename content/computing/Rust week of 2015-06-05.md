-   I submitted [a change] to remove a sentence that is not clear in the
    chapter on Generics in Rust Book.
-   Reading the (excellent) [Traits section of The Rust Reference] led
    me to submit the following improvements:
    -   [One that removes jarring whitespace]
    -   Two more for improving readability:
        -   One by [making use of bullets]
        -   Another by [avoiding needless abbreviations]
    -   Yet another [that adds a link] to the wonderful treatment of the
        trait concept. It was however not accepted, and replaced with
        [one that adds the definition inline].
-   There was also [a typo fix] :)
