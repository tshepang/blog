Rust week of 2015-06-05
=======================

- I submitted `a change`__ to remove a sentence that is not clear in
  the chapter on Generics in Rust Book.

- Reading the (excellent) `Traits section of The Rust Reference`__ led
  me to submit the following improvements:

  * `One that removes jarring whitespace`__

  * Two more for improving readability:

    + One by `making use of bullets`__
    + Another by `avoiding needless abbreviations`__

  * Yet another `that adds a link`__ to the wonderful treatment of the
    trait concept. It was however not accepted, and replaced with `one
    that adds the definition inline`__.

- There was also `a typo fix`__ :)
