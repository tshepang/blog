Rust week of 2015-06-19
=======================

:date: 2015-06-23
:tags: Rust


Work done on `the Documentation chapter`__ of the official Rust book:

- I submitted a number__ of__ changes__

- I also found `misuse of the word, *thing*`__

Elsewhere:

- I submitted `some small fix`__

- I also `want Rust to have a documentation policy`__. This led to
  being pointed to API conventions doc, which needed `some markup fixes`__.
