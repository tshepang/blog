Rust week of 2015-06-26
=======================

:date: 2015-06-27
:tags: Rust


I `removed a sentence`__ that is not needed from Cargo documentation.
I also added `ability to read from $EMAIL environment variable`__ to the
``cargo new`` command, and `fixed a small issue`__ in the test suite..

In the Rust tree:

- I fixed__ one oversight where someone missed removing some obsolete
  doc and annotations while they were removing obsolete code

- I fixed__ some bad code indents

- I added__ an example for reading from stdin
