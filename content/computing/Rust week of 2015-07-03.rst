=======================

:date: 2015-07-06
:tags: Rust



- I made__ a__ bunch__ of__ some__ rather__ small__ changes__ to__
  the__ `Rust Reference`__, including `this bold one`__.

- I made `another change`__, whose preparation forced me to learn more
  closure stuff than I cared for:
  **FnOnce**, **FnMut**, and **Fn**.

- I added some examples__ of array usage to API docs

- I also made `some improvements`__ to the RFC on coercions

- Back to the Reference, I made two additional__ improvements__.
