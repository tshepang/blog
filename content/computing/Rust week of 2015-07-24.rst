I have been `given the honor`__ of Friend of the Tree by a member of
the Rust Library team__. I never expected to be considered, given the
far greater work that previous recipients have done. Is kool stuff.

I submitted these:

- `Removal`__ of a claim that is not accurate
- 2 readability__ improvements__
