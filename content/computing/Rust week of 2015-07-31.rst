Rust week of 2015-07-31
=======================

:date: 2015-08-06
:tags: Rust



I got to use `inotify-rs`__ for some task at work (first time I used
Rust for work, yay!), and I found it surprisingly easy to use. It's
not a very pretty API though, and I remember the Python API to be
horrible too. Maybe the nature of inotify disallows beauty, who knows.

I submitted these to the Rust tree:

- `Follow idiom`__
- `Be more specific`__
- `Add missing info`__
