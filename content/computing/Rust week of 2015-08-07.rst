Rust week of 2015-08-07
=======================

:date: 2015-08-13
:tags: Rust



This time around, I only submitted these__ three__ improvements__.

Elsewhere, I was surprised by the success of this Tweet of mine:

..

    Am so glad #rustlang developers took API naming seriously. A good
    example is the call to remove a file from the
    filesystem... remove_file.

    -- link__

It got nearly 5000 Impressions. It's likely to exceed `the other
surprise success`__, which now got over 6000 Impressions.
