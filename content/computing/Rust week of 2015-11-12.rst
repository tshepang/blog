Rust week of 2015-11-12
=======================

:date: 2015-11-18

I submitted fixes__ for small nits on Ramp, the Rust Arithmetic in
Multiple Precision library. The project was brought to my attention
for being Crate of the Week (source__).

I also `asked for some clarity`__ on a section in the
Reference named `Behavior considered undefined`__.
