Rust week of 2016-01-08
=======================

:date: 2016-01-14
:tags: Rust



As usual, I submitted__ a number__ of small__ doc__ changes__. I am
particularly proud of the code submission__ I made to rustdoc to strip
away the annoying whitespace appended before the final closing brace.

In other news, Rust by Example has `a very illustrative example`__
regarding Box type and size of memory usage of data, and it led me to
submit `a tiny improvement`__.
