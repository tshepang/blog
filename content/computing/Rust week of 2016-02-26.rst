Rust week of 2016-02-26
=======================

:date: 2016-03-03
:tags: Rust


I enjoyed `Comparing Rust and Java`__, the first such comparison I
remember reading. It's also special in that the author hates none of
the two.

In terms of contributions, I am embarassed that I submitted a mere
two__ changes__.
