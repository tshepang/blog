Rust week of 2016-06-03
=======================

I did more Rust coding than most weeks this time around, busy with the
project `I mentioned last week`__. My favorite parts:

- I love the fact that `inotify-rs`__ (`first mention`__) collects
  events in the background, so that when you are done with whatever
  task you were busy with, you can check if there is anything new to
  act upon (e.g. a new file was created in a watched directory). This
  allows one to do away with using threads, reducing code complexity.

- Rust error handling is so nice, and forces one to think better about
  code. As an example, when you doing any I/O, you mostly want to do
  that in a separate function so that you can return a ``Result``
  type, something like ``Result<(), std::io::Error>``. This forces you
  to isolate just the I/O handling part from the other parts of the
  logic, where you'd for maybe just want to return a ``bool`` type.
  In my case, I would not get any I/O error, but I would get failure
  from running an external process (see ``std::process`` module) where
  the exit status was not 0. That meant I/O error failure case and the
  process error case had to be handled in separate places.

- In the example I gave above, ``Result<(), std::io::Error>``, this
  means that we don't care about the success return value. On the
  calling side, we have an option to use a ``match`` statement to
  handle the result:

  .. sourcecode:: rust

     match foo() {
         Ok(_) => (),
         Err(error) => do_something_with(error)
     }

  There is a convenient syntax to deal with such case, where you don't
  care about one of values... ``if let``:

  .. sourcecode:: rust

     if let Err(error) =  foo() {
         do_something_with(error)
     }

  So elegant!

I submitted `just one contribution`__ this time around.
