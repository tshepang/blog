=======================

I struggled hard enough with a ``does not live long enough`` that I
decided to ask for help, and the `solution to my problem`__ was
actually quite simple.

I submitted some__ doc__ fixes__ to various projects, and reported `an
issue`__ that promptly fixed on yet another. `I also ran rustfmt`__ on
some part of Rust.
