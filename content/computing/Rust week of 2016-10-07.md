I am impressed by [the documentation of curl-rust]. It\'s better than
for all Rust crates I\'ve seen yet, if memory serves well. I am grateful
for the painstaking work it must have been for whoever was
responsible\... it\'s a massive API. It could do with more examples
though.

In terms of contributions, I made [just one].
