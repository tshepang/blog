Rust week of 2016-10-07
=======================

I am impressed by `the documentation of curl-rust`__. It's better than
for all Rust crates I've seen yet, if memory serves well. I am
grateful for the painstaking work it must have been for whoever was
responsible... it's a massive API. It could do with more examples
though.

In terms of contributions, I made `just one`__.
