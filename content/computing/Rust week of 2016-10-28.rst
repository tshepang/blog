Rust week of 2016-10-28
=======================

:date: 2016-11-03
:tags: Rust


I learned about the following projects, which I found to be among the
most exciting in the Rust world:

- Cretonne__, an alternative to LLVM
- Corrode__, a C to Rust translator

----

I made just `one contribution`__ this week, and submitted `one issue`__.
