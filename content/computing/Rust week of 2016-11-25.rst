Rust week of 2016-11-25
=======================

:date: 2016-12-01
:tags: Rust


I been wanting to write a Rust reStructuredText parser for the longest
time, and surprised to find that `one has been around for months`__. I
do not have the skills enough to build such a thing, so am glad
someone beat me to it.

In terms of contributions, there were just__ two__ this week.
