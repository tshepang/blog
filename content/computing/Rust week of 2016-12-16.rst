Rust week of 2016-12-16
=======================

I like how easy it seems to create custom template filters,
as seen in `this post about tera`__.
I also like the utility of the derive_builder crate,
as described in `another post`__ (from the same blog).

In terms of contributions, I made `just one`__.
