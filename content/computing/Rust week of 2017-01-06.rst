Rust week of 2017-01-06
=======================

:date: 2017-01-13
:tags: Rust


I asked two__ questions__ on Stack Overflow.
The first led me to use the nifty `lazy_static`__ macro for the first time,
The second led me to submit `a complaint`__
(which got fixed within 3 minutes by the way).

----

I am looking forward to two projects:

- Alacritty__, a fast terminal emulator
- Remacs__, Emacs gradually implemented in Rust

----

As for contributions, I made__ just__ three__.
