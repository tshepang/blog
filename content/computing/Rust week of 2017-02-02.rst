Rust week of 2017-02-02
=======================

I very much enjoyed reading about `the design of Rust futures`__.
It makes me highly appreciate the smarts of those involved,
and how lucky we are to have people building excellent abstractions like such.
In addition, it also nicely summarises Rust traits.

I reported `one issue`__ and made two__ contributions__.
