Rust week of 2017-03-30
=======================

:date: 2017-04-06
:tags: Rust



I very enjoyed reading `this (rather lengthy) comment`__ on a thread
discussing Rust CStr/Cstring APIs.
It shows great depth of knowledge and shows no fear of expressing
strong opinions... I loves it.
As for the argument itself,
I don't know enough to have a qualified opinion,
though the opposition is quite strong against the proposal
(to deprecate those APIs).

I also made two__ contributions__,
and submitted two__ complaints__.
