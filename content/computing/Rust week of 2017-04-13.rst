Rust week of 2017-04-13
=======================

:date: 2017-04-20
:tags: Rust


Continuing on the work from `last week`__,
I found a far more pleasant MQTT client library, mqttc__,
and managed to send probor__ messages across.
I also submitted `a small note for the README`__
regarding payload size.
