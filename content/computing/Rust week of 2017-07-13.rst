Rust week of 2017-07-13
=======================

:date: 2017-07-19
:tags: Rust



I am tempted, `once again`__, to try out Remacs__,
a Rust port of GNU Emacs.
It's very encouraging that it tries to be compatible,
for the drop-in-replacement effect.

I am glad `the change to add subcommands to structopt`__
has been merged. It was the one important missing piece to `this
wonderful project`__.
I also made `a contribution`__ to the project.
