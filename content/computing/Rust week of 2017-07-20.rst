Rust week of 2017-07-20
=======================

:date: 2017-07-24
:tags: Rust


I am surprised by the ease of changing default Rust toolchain:

    # switch to nightly
    rustup default nightly
    # switch to stable
    rustup default stable

This is more easy than remembering how to tell cargo to use to use a
non-default toolchain, though that approach is not too bad either:

    # build with nightly
    cargo +nightly build

I made two__ complaints__,
as__ well__ as__ five__ contributions__.
