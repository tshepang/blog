Rust week of 2017-07-27 (special edition)
=========================================

:date: 2017-08-04
:tags: Rust


I been using this series to help push me into constant Rust activity,
ensuring I do not skip a week sitting idle.
It worked in that, indeed, no 7 days passed without a single
contribution to the ecosystem, no matter how tiny,
and this has been going on for over a 100 weeks
(i.e. `since 2015-05-15`__, also Rust 1.0 release date).

The problem is I felt silly recording the tiny parts,
stuff like a typo fixes, just to keep this going.
Well, it's time to stop that.
I intend to avoid recording such,
and if it means no blog post for that week, so be it.

*This was inspired by having a laptop failure,
with a draft that wasn't backed up anywhere.
That draft only consisted of a list of those tiny contributions,
and it felt extra silly trying to recreate it for publication.*
