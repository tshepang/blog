Rust week of 2017-10-12
=======================

:date: 2017-10-18
:tags: Rust



I enjoyed `a humorous joke post`__ poking fun at inconsistent Rust
naming of some stdlib types.
I also expanded `the work project`__ I been working on the past few
weeks, this time doing some file I/O among other things,
which is always finicky business.
