Rust week of 2017-12-28
=======================

Very little Rust last week, but this week I played some with termion__
for some user interface on a private project.
I borrowed some of the code from `a project I mentioned previously`__,
one where I used the library for the first time.
As was the case with that project,
I found handling of keyboard input tedious and non-intuitive,
and imagine there must be an easier way.

We had `another monthly meetup`__ (we've had several of them so far),
which was the usual random informal discussion of the
exciting ecosystem of the great language that is Rust.
