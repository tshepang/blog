Over the past 3 weeks, I continued work on [a project I mentioned
previously], a CLI UI for work. In addition to dependencies mentioned
there, I used [rust-ini] and [serde\_yaml], I mostly enjoyed the
experience, though not too happy with the code, which feels messy\... I
use [termion::AsynReader], which means I have to loop all over the place
while waiting for stdin (keyboard input). I imagine there is a better
way.
