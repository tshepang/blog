Rust weeks of 2017-09-14 to 2017-09-28
======================================

:date: 2017-10-04
:tags: Rust



Over the past 3 weeks,
I continued work on `a project I mentioned previously`__,
a CLI UI for work.
In addition to dependencies mentioned there,
I used rust-ini__ and `serde_yaml`__,
I mostly enjoyed the experience,
though not too happy with the code, which feels messy...
I use `termion::AsynReader`__, which means I have to loop all over
the place while waiting for stdin (keyboard input).
I imagine there is a better way.
