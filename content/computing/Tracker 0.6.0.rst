Tracker 0.6.0
=============

:date: 2007-07-25
:tags: Tracker



6 months have passed since the `previous Tracker release`_ and it's real
great to have `another fresh one`_. During development, its GUI
interface (TST) has went through two revamps, each being an improvement
on the previous one. This implies that those who have only ever used
that January's release have missed a TST which had categories (All
Files, Documents, Images, ...) which were presented as tabs, which
shouldn't matter anyways since the current interface, which uses a
sidebar instead, rocks like hell. Another highlight is the inclusion of
tracker-preferences UI which allows for easy configuration.
