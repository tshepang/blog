a talk on what software engineering should be
=============================================

I really enjoyed `this humorous, eye-opening, and informative talk`__
that draws parallels between software and traditional engineering
disciplines. The presenter really did good research to prepare for the
presentation (which he heartily enjoyed), but unfortunately flies too
quick near the end when realizing he's out of time, without properly
explaining what he proposes as **real** software engineering.
