I respect a lot of software developers, but many of those are not going
to have an entry in [this series], and not because they are lesser in my
eyes\... I need a news item that would trigger a post. Thing is, if you
write about someone, you actually need to have some content (duh!), and
saying \"Guide van Rossum rocks for creating Python, and am grateful!\"
is simply not enough, hence a need for a trigger. In fact, I used to
call this series *developer of the moment*, but at some point felt that
the new name is more fitting, especially since a few of these developers
generated some new triggers along the way.
