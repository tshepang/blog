about 'developer of note' series
================================

:tags: developer-of-note


I respect a lot of software developers, but many of those are not
going to have an entry in this series, and not because they are lesser
in my eyes... this is what needs to happen for someone to be in `this
series`__:

* I need a news item that would trigger a post.  Thing is, if you
  write about someone, you actually need to have some content (duh!),
  and saying "Guide van Rossum rocks for creating Python, and am
  grateful!"  is simply not enough, hence a need for a trigger.  In
  fact, I used to call this series *developer of the moment*, but at
  some point felt that the new name is more fitting, especially since
  a few of these honorable developers actually generated some new
  triggers along the way.

* The more obvious requirement is that the developer needs to have
  done some thing that I truly appreciate.  At times, I fail to put
  into words just how much.
