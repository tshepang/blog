am joining Gittip
=================

:tags: Python


In `Why I'm signing up for Gittip`__, a core CPython commiter, Brett Cannon,
mentions a great reason to reward FLOSS contributors financially:

    ... a way for the community to thank someone's family for letting them share
    their loved one with open source.
    For instance, tips for me would be a way of thanking my wife for letting
    me spend the hours I do contributing to Python in my various ways by
    letting me treat my wife to a night out so neither of us has to cook.

He inspired me to actually go find a bit more about this Gittip__ thing,
after which `I decided to participate`__ as well.

In terms of money, I previously fooled around with flattr__ too,
but stopped along the way for some reason (after a few months),
so will see how long this one relationship lasts.
