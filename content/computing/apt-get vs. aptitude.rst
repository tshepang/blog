Did I mention that `I love Stack Overflow`_? It's a Q&A site for
anything that is related to computer programing, and the creators
(luckily) didn't just stop there. They went on to create a bunch of
other sites using the same technology and branding, covering other
topics (and they aggregate `the best new content`_ from those sites).

Enough with background info. What prompted this post is `the answer`_ to
the question, "`what's the difference between apt-get and
aptitude?`_". This is from one of their sites, *Unix and Linux*, and
the answer is really thorough. Part of the question was "what the heck
is wajig" and I really liked how that part was handled as well. It
serves as a nice reminder of why the heck I'm working on `wajig`_ in the
first place... it rocks!
