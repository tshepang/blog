blog of note: We'll See (Matt Zimmerman)
========================================

I'm a regular reader of `Planet Debian`_, so I frequently bump onto Matt
Zimmerman's blog. This a Debian Developer who also happens to do paid
work on Ubuntu as well (employed by Canonical). He writes clearly and
with a sober and mature tone. It's very interesting when you see a
software developer conversant with non-technical stuff, and able to
write about it so well.

-  I started with one post with an obviously interesting title, "`How to
   decide what to read (and what not to read)?`_". This piqued my
   interest also because I've been thinking about `my own activities on
   the web`_ too. Also, his mention of News closely match mine, other
   than that I'm simply (mostly) not interested in traditional big news
   (presidents approves blah) and tabloids, and normally get enough of a
   dose from co-workers and friends, and mostly face-to-face.
-  This led to another, "`Breadth and depth`_", in which he touches on
   the social effects of web-enabled technology. This is a topic that
   has been beaten to death of course, but he fortunately keeps his
   contribution very brief and fresh, and I like that he doesn't claim
   to offer any solutions, but merely exploring them.
-  And there was "`Internet discussion trends: from Usenet to
   micro-blogs`_", where he discussed various ways forms of on-line
   discussion, which is the first topic of its type I've seen yet.
-  He even dabbled with a bit of poetry in "`Breathing information`_".
   Nice attempt.
-  He also displays an insightful understanding of what package
   management in "`We've packaged all of the free software...what
   now?`_".

There's a whole bunch of gorgeous-sounding posts that I didn't care to
read yet, and hope to keep the above list updated when I do.
