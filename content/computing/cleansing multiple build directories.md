In my adventures of [building GNOME with JHBuild], it often happens that
when I tweak something that affects the build environment (e.g.Â use
system Python instead of JHBuild-built one), I get a heck of a lot of
build failures. This will happen even after I run jhbuild clean (which
runs `make clean` on the modules), testimony to the weakness ofthe GNOME
build infrastructure (autotools, \...). This means that I need to run
`make distclean` or better still (where applicable) `git clean -dfx`.
Note that I sometimes even have to uninstall one or two modules (on
JHBuild path) to get a build failure fixe
(`jhbuild uninstall modulename`). This is laborious work, so I sometimes
just wipe out the entire installation.

Note that there\'s dozens of modules to build, so I wrote this little
script to take care of it:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
import os
import subprocess
top_level = os.path.expanduser("~/src/gnome")
for filename in os.listdir(top_level):
    full_path = "{}/{}".format(top_level, filename)
    if os.path.isdir(full_path):
        cmd = "cd ~/src/gnome/{} && git clean -dfx".format(filename)
        if subprocess.call(cmd, shell=True) != 0:
            cmd = "cd ~/src/gnome/{} && make distclean".format(filename)
            if subprocess.call(cmd, shell=True) != 0:
                cmd = "cd ~/src/gnome/{} && make clean".format(filename)
                subprocess.call(cmd, shell=True)
```

update
======

Someone very kind guy made [a bunch of suggestions], making my code much
better:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
import os
import subprocess
top_level = os.path.expanduser("~/src/gnome")
for filename in os.listdir(top_level):
    full_path = os.path.join(top_level, filename)
    if os.path.isdir(full_path):
        os.chdir(full_path)
        if subprocess.call("git clean -dfx".split()) != 0:
            if subprocess.call("make distclean".split()) != 0:
                subprocess.call("make clean".split())
```
