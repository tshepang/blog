companies I deeply appreciate
=============================


-  `Red Hat`_ contributes more to `FLOSS`_ than any other company,
   employing hundreds of developers to work full-time on it.

-  Google

   -  Runs `the Summer of Code program`_, which pays hundreds of
      students to work full-time for a few months on FLOSS projects of
      their choosing.

   -  Provides Gmail for gratis, which I use as my primary web address.

   -  Funds the development of Chromium,
      a very credible alternative to the world's major web browsers,
      and my personal favorite. It's also FLOSS.

   -  Funds most of the development of Android, which is quickly
      becoming the dominant platform for high-end phones, and also
      happens to be mostly FLOSS (though I hate the closed development).

-  The `Stack Exchange`_ family of sites attempt to provide the best Q&A
   for a wide array of topics. They have succeeded specifically in one
   topic, programming, in a form of `Stack Overflow`_.

-  Atlassian_ offers Bitbucket_,
   a gratis hosting service for public software projects;
   this is a great thing, but not special since there are others offering
   the same, most notably GitHub_.
   What makes it special is that it also offers gratis hosting
   for unlimited private repositories.
   I have over a dozen such repositories and each time I create one,
   I feel like the world is a wonderful place... I am grateful.
