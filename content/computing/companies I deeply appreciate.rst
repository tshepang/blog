companies I deeply appreciate
=============================

:tags: list


-  `Red Hat`__ contributes more to FLOSS__ than any other company,
   employing hundreds of developers to work full-time on it.

-  Google runs `the Summer of Code program`__, which pays hundreds of
   students to work full-time for a few months on FLOSS projects of
   their choosing.

-  The `Stack Exchange`__ family of sites attempt to provide the best Q&A
   for a wide array of topics. The most popular of these is `Stack Overflow`__.

-  Atlassian__ offers Bitbucket__,
   a gratis hosting service for public software projects;
   this is a great thing, but not special since there are others offering
   the same, most notably GitHub__.
   What makes it special is that it also offers gratis hosting
   for unlimited private repositories.
   I have over a dozen such repositories and each time I create one,
   I feel like the world is a wonderful place... I am grateful.
