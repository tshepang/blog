The `Tracker`_ team got this new guy, `Aleksander Morgado`_, `doing`_
`fabulous`_ `work`_ `on`_ Tracker's extraction code.
He does so while also providing thorough info on his activities.

One thing that prompted me to honor him is his work on adding options to
disable stop words, as well as to enable number indexing,
fixing an old gripe of mine.
