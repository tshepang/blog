Debian got so many people doing what seem like thankless jobs in an
effort to improve it. One of those guys is Alexander Reichle-Schmehl
(look at my struggling tongue), who has for a number of months been
pushing an initiative to fix a bunch of RC-bugs weekly (`here's the
post`_ that inspired this award). Other than that, this developer has
been busy `keeping track of RC bug counts`_, reducing the need for me to
go check myself.
