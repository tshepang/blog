developer of note: Alexander Reichle-Schmehl
============================================

:tags: Debian, developer-of-note



Debian got so many people doing what seem like thankless jobs in an
effort to improve it. One of those guys is Alexander Reichle-Schmehl
(look at my struggling tongue), who has for a number of months been
pushing an initiative to fix a bunch of RC bugs weekly (example__).
This developer has been busy `keeping track of RC bug counts`__,
reducing the need for me to go check myself.
