=============================

:date: 2013-10-13
:tags: developer-of-note, Python, quote


Co-founder and lead developer of arguably the most exciting project in
the entire Python ecosystem, PyPy_.  He is also credited with doing
the bulk of the work in building its `legendary RPython translation
framework`_.

What inspired this post (originally published 2013-03-31) is the
incredible honor given by the great Raymond Hettinger in `one of his
PyCon US 2013 talks`_, where he deems him "probably the smartest
person I have ever met".  Given that there isn't a shortage of
brilliance in the Python community, that's some serious kudos.

Also, here is what one of speakers at that conferences said:

    ... Armin Rigo is awesome - he's perhaps the only incredibly
    intelligent person involved with programming I've met who seemed
    genuinely happy about life (and not grumpy at all).
