Co-founder and lead developer of arguably the most exciting project in
the entire Python ecosystem, PyPy_.  He is also credited with doing
the bulk of the work in building its `legendary RPython translation
framework`_.

What inspired this post is the incredible honor given by the great
Raymond Hettinger in `one of his PyCon US 2013 talks`_, where he deems
him "probably the smartest person I have ever met".  Given that there
isn't a shortage of brilliance in the Python community, that's some
serious kudos.
