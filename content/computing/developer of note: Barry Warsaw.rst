This guy, both an official Ubuntu developer and a core `CPython`__
developer, is a great example of a FLOSS collaborator. He is always
polite on mailing list discussions, kindly and `patiently helps foster
collaboration between Debian and Ubuntu`__ (there's been some
conflicts between the two camps).  This is on top of his superb
technical efforts demonstrated by his highly-detailed guides on
various things, like upgrading various Python projects to run on
Python 3 (`example 1`__, `example 2`__, `example 3`__).
