This guy, both an official Ubuntu developer and a core `CPython`_
developer, is a great example of a FLOSS collaborator. He is always
polite on mailing list discussions, kindly and patiently helps foster
collaboration between Debian and Ubuntu (there's been some faction
fighting between the 2 camps, and some duplicated packaging efforts).
This is on top of his superb technical efforts demonstrated by his
highly-detailed guides on various things, like upgrading various Python
projects to run on Python 3 (`example1`_, `example2`_, `example3`_) and
his mastery of the arcane Debian/Ubuntu Python packaging.
