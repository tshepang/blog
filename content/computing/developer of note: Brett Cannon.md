[A core CPython developer], Dr.Â Brett Cannon is among the key people
pushing Python 3 forward, examples being:

-   He once developed [a site] that displayed progress of support by
    major Python projects.
-   He repeatedly gives talks on the topic.
-   Most recently, he has developed [a tool that checks which
    dependencies of a project lack Python 3 support]. It\'s weird that a
    tool like this is only available now, over 5 years since Python 3.0
    was released.

In addition to that:

-   [He keeps improving the Python import system], which is reportedly a
    complex beast.
-   I am grateful that [he championed the move from Subversion to
    Mercurial for CPython development]. I held back participating in
    CPython development until this move was complete\... Subversion is
    that painful to use.
-   He created [Python Developer's Guide], a great guide for those
    wishing to help out with core CPython development.
-   Personally, [he inspired me to take a serious look at Gittip],
    resulting in my participation.

There\'s a lot more stuff he been doing for Python. Busy, busy guy.
