developer of note: Brett Cannon
===============================

:tags: developer-of-note, Python



`A core CPython developer`__, Dr. Brett Cannon is among the key people
pushing Python 3 forward, examples being:

* He once developed `a site`__ that displayed progress of support by major
  Python projects.
* He repeatedly gives talks on the topic.
* Most recently, he has developed `a tool that checks which
  dependencies of a project lack Python 3 support`__. It's weird that
  a tool like this is only available now, over 5 years since Python
  3.0 was released.

In addition to that:

* `He keeps improving the Python import system`__, which is reportedly a
  complex beast.
* I am grateful that `he championed the move from Subversion to
  Mercurial for CPython development`__. I held back participating in
  CPython development until this move was complete... I Subversion is
  that painful to use.
* He created `Python Developerâ€™s Guide`__, a great guide for those
  wishing to help out with core CPython development.
* Personally, `he inspired me to take a serious look at Gittip`__,
resulting in my participation.

There's a lot more stuff he been doing for Python. Busy, busy guy.
