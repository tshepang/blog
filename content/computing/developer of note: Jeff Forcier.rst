The strength of character that [Jeff \'bitprophet\' Forcier] possesses
is admirable. He is the lead developer of [fabric], the most popular
deployment tool written in Python. I honor him here due to how he
handled the issues with [paramiko], the library that fabric uses
heavily. He had to make tough decisions, like embedding that library in
fabric source (due to various issues), and even forking it. All of this
of course involved a lot of work and discussing, and thankfully at the
end, the original \'owner\' of that indispensable piece of software
relented and transferred it to this bitprophet character. This means
Jeff now runs 2 of the most important tools in all of the Python
