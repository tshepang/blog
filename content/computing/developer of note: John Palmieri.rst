Every so often, there appears a developer who pressures me away from
my lazy, unfocused, and undisciplined ass to go do some useful
programming.  This time around it's John Palmieri, the most visible of
the developers of PyGObject__ (Python bindings for GTK+ and GLib).
The old way of using GTK+ with Python has for years been PyGTK and
this guy has been tirelessly working to move the world to the more
modern PyGObject, and has led at least one coding sprint to help
achieve this goal.  He also appears friendly and humble. He rocks!
