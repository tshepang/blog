Every so often, there appears a developer who pressures me away from my
lazy, unfocused, and undisciplined ass to go do some useful programming.
This time around it's `John Palmieri`_, the most visible of the
developers of `PyGObject`_ (Python bindings for GTK+ and GLib).
The old way of using GTK+ with Python has for years been PyGTK and this guy has
been tirelessly working to move the world to the more modern PyGObject,
and has led at least one coding sprint to help achieve this goal.
He also appears friendly and humble. He rocks!
