The efforts that Josselin Mouette puts into maintaining Debian's GNOME
are amazing (and seemingly thankless). He is the most visible member of
that team-maintained part of Debian. He also portrays deep knowledge of
GNOME's oft-inconsistent and oft-complex internals, and does participate
in upstream discussions.

Here are two examples of his heroic efforts:

-  His `great summary`_ of GNOME's then-current release status.
-  With the release of GNOME 3, here he prepares `a migration plan`_.
