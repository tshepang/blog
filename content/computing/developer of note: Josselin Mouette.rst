The efforts that Josselin Mouette puts into maintaining Debian\'s GNOME
are amazing (and seemingly thankless). He is the most visible member of
that team-maintained part of Debian. He also portrays deep knowledge of
GNOME\'s oft-inconsistent and oft-complex internals, and does
participate in upstream discussions.

Here are two examples of his heroic efforts:

-   His [great summary] of GNOME\'s then-current release status.
-   With the release of GNOME 3, here he prepares [a migration plan].
