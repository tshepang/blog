Manoj Srivastava has for a number of years been Project Secretary, a
very key role in Debian, a role where the incumbent runs project voting.
What prompted this post is [his recent resignation], which was
encouraged by hostility towards the handling of the recent controversial
ballot. As evidenced by the [various][] [supporters] and my own
experience, he happens to be among the wisest of all DD\'s. He is also
among the most senior of all, having been involved since 1995.
