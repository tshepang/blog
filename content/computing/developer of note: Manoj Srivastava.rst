developer of note: Manoj Srivastava

Manoj Srivastava has for a number of years been Project Secretary,
a very key role in Debian, a role where the incumbent
runs project voting. What prompted this post is `his recent
resignation`_, which was encouraged by hostility towards the handling of
the recent controversial ballot. As evidenced by the `various`_
`supporters`_ and my own experience, he happens to be among the wisest
of all DD's. He is also among the most senior of all,
having been involved since 1995.
