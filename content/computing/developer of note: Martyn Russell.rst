Martyn Russell is [Tracker]\'s release manager, and being a fan of the
project since the early pre-1.0 days, I have quite familiar with his
work. But what triggered this honor is his work on [Tracker Needle]
(written in Vala), Tracker\'s new GUI search tool, to replace the
inadequate Tracker Search Tool (written in C). I\'ve taken a look, and
the design is pretty modern (check the video he gives in his
[announcement][Tracker Needle]).

But Martyn has of course done [far more] for Tracker, and does a pretty
damn good job managing the release. One thing he did outside of Tracker
that I\'m aware of is the re-design the <http://gtk.org> page, giving it
a very modern look (which it desperately needed).
