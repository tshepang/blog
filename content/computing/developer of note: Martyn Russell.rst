Martyn Russell is Tracker_'s release manager,
and being a fan of the project since the early pre-1.0 days,
I have quite familiar with his work.
But what triggered this honor is his work on `Tracker Needle`_
(written in Vala), Tracker's new GUI search tool,
to replace the inadequate Tracker Search Tool (written in C).
I've taken a look, and the design is pretty modern
(check the video he gives in his announcement_).

But Martyn has of course done `far more`_ for Tracker, and does a pretty
damn good job managing the release.
One thing he did outside of Tracker that I'm aware of is the
re-design the http://gtk.org page, giving it a very modern look (which
it desperately needed).
