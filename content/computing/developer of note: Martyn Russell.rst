developer of note: Martyn Russell
=================================

So, what's the criteria I use to regard someone as *developer of the
moment*? I need a news item that would trigger that. That means there's
a heck of a lot of developers I respect that haven't pitched in this
`series`_. One of those developers is `Tracker`_'s release manager,
Martyn Russell, until now of course.

So, what triggered this honor? His work on `Tracker Needle`_, Tracker's
future (and so far unreleased) GUI search tool, to replace the
inadequate Tracker Search Tool. I've taken a look, and the design is
pretty modern (check the video he gives in his `announcement`_).

But Martyn has of course done `far more`_ for Tracker, and does a pretty
damn good job managing the release (basically, Tracker's Guido van
Rossum). One thing he did outside of Tracker that I'm aware of is the
re-design the http://gtk.org page, giving it a very modern look (which
it desperately needed). He rocks hard!
