developer of note: Michael Biebl

So I really do honor all Debian Developers especially when they are
named `Michael Biebl`_. This guy is the lone maintainer of `Tracker`_
and rsyslog in Debian (among others). Not just that but he is also a
co-maintainer of a large number of GNOME technologies (gnome-session,
dbus, avahi, gnome-power-manager, gvfs, hal, network-manager...).

I love especially his role as some sorta QA for Tracker (he's done a
terrific job of it — most recently offering `a bunch of patches`_ to fix
some linking problems in the code). Oh, and I'm not the only one who
noticed — `the great Josselin Mouette`_, `did offer accolades too`_ for
Michael's other work.
