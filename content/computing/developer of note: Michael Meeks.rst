developer of note: Michael Meeks
================================

:tags: GNOME, developer-of-note



Being the most visible LibreOffice (and formerly, OpenOffice.org)
developer for a few years now, he is also a tireless communicator and
organiser. The switch from OpenOffice.org to LibreOffice was not exactly
a smooth ride, but this guy kept showing a positive attitude throughout. In
`the latest`__ of his longer-form blog posts (he normally writes tiny
updates), he exposes the great progress that LibreOffice has had. This
is not the most glamorous of software projects, but it certainly is
among the most important in the world of FLOSS__, and it's kool to have
people keeping it going.
