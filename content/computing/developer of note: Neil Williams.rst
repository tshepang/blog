For some years now, Neil Williams has been working on Emdebian (embedded
Debian). It's a Debian sub-project where normal Debian packages are
stripped of certain things like documentation and translations, making
it more suitable for space-constrained embedded devices. He's now
started `a series of posts`_ explaining how it works... and it seems an
elegant system actually.
