developer of note: Nick Coghlan
===============================

This is easily among the most active of all core CPython developers.
His productivity is ridiculous, and I seriously wonder how he manages
to do all he does, especially since `he does it in his free time`_. He
also tends to be quite stern, which is extra kool since he does it
while displaying `great depth of knowledge`_ and `maturity`_.  Also,
his great work has been `officially recognized by the Python Software
Foundation`_.

The first work that prompted this recognition as `developer of note`_
is the proposal, `PEP 413`_. The idea is that the Python standard
library (stdlib) should release at a quicker rate than the Python
language itself.  This is a nice balance between two camps: those
favoring *stability* over quicker availability of features, and those
favoring the opposite.  The PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) is quite
thorough, and is partly in opposition to the earlier `PEP 407`_, which
proposes that all of CPython (the language and its stdlib) should
release faster.  Nick Coghlan outlines the disadvantages with that
approach in PEP 413 as well.

One other PEP he is working on, and takes more seriously (`PEP 413`_
was more like he playing a devil's advocate, as it later transpired)
is `PEP 432`_. There, he happens to expose his deep knowledge on
CPython internals, and is also incredibly-detailed.

He also builds and maintains a collection of notes known simply as
`Nick Coghlan's Python Notes`_. There is much wisdom there (complete
with high quality clear writing), favorite of which is the just-updated
`Incremental Plans to Improve Python Packaging`_, a thorough write-up
on the history, current state, and future plans regarding the story of
packaging (and installation) in the Python ecosystem.  He also happens
to be a great champion in pushing for progress on that front.
