There hasn\'t been anyone who has [publicly talked about Tracker] as
hard as Phillip van Hoof ever since the project was started a few years
ago. He has recently [outlined the current improvements and future
plans] to make it rock even harder (and of course I understand very
little of it, since there\'s jargon all over the place, and [Tracker]
actually covers new ground).
