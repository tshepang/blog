There hasn't been anyone who has `publicly talked about Tracker`_ as
hard as Phillip van Hoof ever since the project was started a few years
ago. He has recently `outlined the current improvements and future
plans`_ to make it rock even harder (and of course I understand very
little of it, since there's jargon all over the place, and `Tracker`_
actually covers new ground).
