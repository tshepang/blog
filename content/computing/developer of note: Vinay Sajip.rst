developer of note: Vinay Sajip
==============================

`Vinay Sajip`_ is the maintainer of `logging`_, a Python logging
library/module, available in the standard library. What prompted this
post is his tireless improvements, not just to the software itself, but
also the documentation surrounding it (`example`_). It's all the more
impressive that he continuously blogs about various ways to use the
module, and maintains `a bunch of nuggets on advanced usage`_.

One early event that brought attention to the guy, and perhaps the first
time I noticed him, is the time when he rebutted some apparently
inaccurate claims against the module, at which he responded in a
`highly-detailed post`_, the sort that lent credence to the module. This
inspired me to give it a try, and `it's not that hard`_.

There's one other project he works on, `sarge`_, which is like
`subprocess`_ on steroids. Have a look at `why he created it`_.

Lately, he is working on `distlib`_,
a library which implements low-level functions that relate to
packaging and distribution of Python software.
This excites me a lot since it's a key piece in the latest attempt
at fixing Python packaging once and for all.

On top of all this, he is very active on Stack Overflow,
having answered `hundreds of questions`_ there. Amazing!
