title: discarding Scribes for Geany
---

The [version of Scribes in development] didn\'t prove too satisfactory
after a while (black background which I didn\'t care to investigate how
to revert to normal, among whatever other trouble I don\'t remember) and
there was me also unloving the idea of switching text editors, so
decided to get [stuck with Geany], and am not complaining much. It\'s
been a year-and-a-half of pleasure and pain and it was well worth it.
