discarding Scribes for Geany
============================

The `version of Scribes in development`_ didn't prove too satisfactory
after a while (black background which I didn't care to investigate how
to revert to normal, among whatever other trouble I don't remember) and
there was me also unloving the idea of switching text editors, so
decided to get `stuck with Geany`_, and am not complaining much. It's
been a year-and-a-half of pleasure and pain and it was well worth it.
