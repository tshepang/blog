games in Debian

`Blob Wars`_, which resembles Mario, has become a serious hit with my
9-year-old brother and a number of friends, which makes me happy since
it could very well become their GNU/Linux killer app. I came across it
while looking for some Debian games on the request of that brother, who
was then responsible for spreading its fame.

Also, `Ceferino`_, a more favorite of mine, seems to also be catching up
with Blob Wars with that same game-lover crew.
