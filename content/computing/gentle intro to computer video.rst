gentle intro to computer video

:date: 2010-06-06



While caught up in the hysteria that is HTML5, I bumped onto a
good-looking `Dive Into HTML5`_, and what mainly interested me is the
`chapter on video`_. I'm seduced by the hope that it will replace Flash,
a technology that has been a pain for GNU/Linux user for years (and
still is to a lesser extent).
