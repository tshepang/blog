    ... the job of QA is to determine whether things are working as
    intended, not to decide what the intentions should be.

    -- `part of a thread`__ on Fedora's main development mailing list

The author goes on to give some solid advice which is applicable to
pretty much every notable project out there:

    It is not possible, however you organize such a project, for
    everyone to have a voice in everything. It is not possible to
    subject every decision to some kind of public review process. It
    is a statistical certainty that things you disagree with are going
    to happen. This is something you need to reconcile yourself to.
