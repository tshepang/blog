koolest projekts
================

:date: 2014-03-18
:tags: Python, non-Python



These are what I find to be the most exciting projects, today:

* PyPy__

  It's been alive for over 10 years, but it's still generally
  considered among the most exciting of all Python projects.

* systemd__

  This one has since been `announced in April 2010`__, but I still do
  find it kool. It is sad that it still receives so much unlove from
  so many people, much of which isn't constructive. I am hoping it
  displaces both it's main competitors, sysvinit and upstart, at some
  point.
