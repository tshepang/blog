-  `my first CPython feature request`_; unsurprisingly, it was rejected

-  I still can't comprehend why Ubuntu gods decided to put their window
   controls on the left, and so does `this guy`_ (`via`_)

-  `Operating Systems Lifecycle Chart`_ â€“ nice presentation, nice site
   design

-  `The tools`_ used by one very advanced Debian user; this is quality
   and in-depth writing.

-  Someone claimed `Gnucash was to blame`_ for her move to Linux-based
   systems; for another, `the tool was Meld`_.
