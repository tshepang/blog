-   [\"A prayer to the programming gods\"] - decent humor
-   [A bit of Zope history, how it rocked, and how it sucked] - makes me
    respect [Pyramid] even more.
-   [A scathing read regarding incompencies of developers] - for the
    sake of completeness, he should have mentioned that developers often
    don\'t have time to fully understand technologies they are often
    commanded (by employers) to work with.
-   [on the frustrations of waiting too long to get help] - great humor
