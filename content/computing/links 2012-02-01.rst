-  `"A prayer to the programming gods"`_ – decent humor

-  `A bit of Zope history, how it rocked, and how it sucked`_ – makes me
   respect `Pyramid`_ even more.

-  `A scathing read regarding incompencies of developers`_; for the sake
   of completeness, he should have mentioned that developers often don't
   have time to fully understand technologies they are often commanded
   (by employers) to work with.

-  `a funny way of expressing the frustrations of waiting too long to
   get help`_
