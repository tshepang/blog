- `"A prayer to the programming gods"`__ - decent humor

- `A bit of Zope history, how it rocked, and how it sucked`__ - makes
  me respect `Pyramid`__ even more.

- `A scathing read regarding incompencies of developers`__ - for the
  sake of completeness, he should have mentioned that developers
  often don't have time to fully understand technologies they are
  often commanded (by employers) to work with.

- `on the frustrations of waiting too long to get help`__ - great humor
