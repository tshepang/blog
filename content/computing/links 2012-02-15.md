-   [The amount of testing] SQLite goes through before each release is
    impressive.
-   [A stern slap on the wrist] of noisy people; it\'s a well-informed
    rebuttal against the famous \"the CPython GIL sucketh\" complaint.
-   [This subprocess wrapper] looks immensely powerful; I haven\'t
    needed its extra features yet, but I love the elegance and seeming
    ease-of-use.
-   A superb, highly-detailed [code review] by [Winston Ewert].
-   [This guy][Winston Ewert] (same one mentioned above) exposed [my
    sloppiness] as a programmer; I was nearly embarassed.
