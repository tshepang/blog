- `The amount of testing`__ SQLite goes through before each release is
  impressive.

- `A stern slap on the wrist`__ of noisy people; it's a well-informed
  rebuttal against the famous "the CPython GIL sucketh" complaint.

- `This subprocess wrapper`__ looks immensely powerful; I haven't
  needed its extra features yet, but I love the elegance and seeming
  ease-of-use.

- A superb, highly-detailed `code review`__ by `Winston Ewert`__.

- `This guy`__ (same one mentioned above) exposed `my sloppiness`__ as
  a programmer; I was nearly embarassed.
