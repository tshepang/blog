-  `The amount of testing`_ SQLite goes through before each release is
   impressive.

-  `a stern slap on the wrist`_ of noisy people; it's a well-informed
   rebuttal against the famous "the CPython GIL sucketh" complaint.

-  `This subprocess wrapper`_ looks immensely powerful; I haven't needed
   its extra features yet, but I love the elegance and seeming
   ease-of-use.

-  A superb, highly-detailed `code review`_ by `Winston Ewert`_.

-  `This guy`_ (same one mentioned above) exposed `my sloppiness`_ as a
   programmer; I was nearly embarassed.
