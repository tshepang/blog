-  A highly detailed demonstration of `SQLite performance`_, which also
   goes through various ways of tuning it.

-  `Advice to Aimless, Excited Programmers`_; this sort of advice is not
   nothing new but the writer is so good and the site design so clean
   that it oughta be kinda canonical.

-  `Nobody Wants to Learn How to Program`_; interesting advice on
   teaching programming.

-  `a gentle tutorial`_ on Python's ``xml.etree.ElementTree`` module

-  It's very interesting to see `a browser with relatively little use`_
   continue getting developed, while monsters like Firefox,
   Chrome/Chromium, and Safari have (almost) taken over the world.
