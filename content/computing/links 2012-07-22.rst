- Great points on `the limitations of Planet Python`_, my main source
  of news on Python-related stuff.

- People tend to oppose radical change and then later on admit that
  change wasn't that bad; in `this one case`_, an apology was even
  given.

- A `great explanation`_ on how whether or not Python passes arguments
  by reference value.

- If anyone ever complains, "oh, now I have to fill my hard drive by
  having to pull all of that Mono shit", she should be forced to read
  `this blog post`_; also applies to me at times.

- am working on giving a product of ours ability to speak Socket CAN,
  and I really appreciate its `official documentation`_ on it, which
  is well-written and thorough; one more reason to be grateful of the
  Linux kernel project
