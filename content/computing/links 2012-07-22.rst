-  great points on `the limitations of Planet Python`_, my main source
   of news on Python-related stuff

-  people tend to oppose radical change and then later on admit that
   change wasn't that bad; in `this one case`_, an apology was even
   given

-  `great article`_ on how Python neither passes arguments by reference
   nor value

-  if anyone ever complains, "oh, now I have to fill my hard drive by
   having to pull all of that Mono shit", she should be read `this blog
   post`_; also applies to me, `a non-so-pragmattic fundamentalist
   dreamer`_

-  am working on giving a product of ours ability to speak Socket CAN,
   and I really appreciate its `official documentation`_ on it, which is
   well-written and thorough; one more reason to be grateful of the
   Linux kernel project
