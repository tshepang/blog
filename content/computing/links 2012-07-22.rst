- Great points on `the limitations of Planet Python`_, my main source
  of news on Python-related stuff.

- People tend to oppose radical change and then later on admit that
  change wasn't that bad; in `this one case`_, an apology was even
  given.

- A `great explanation`__ to the question *Does Python pass by
  reference or pass by value?*

- Am working on giving a product of ours ability to speak Socket CAN,
  and I really appreciate its `official documentation`_ on it, which
  is quite well-written and thorough (but assumes prior knowledge of
  working sockets); one more reason to be grateful of the Linux kernel
  project.
