-   I did not expect [this question of mine] to be loved so much. In
    fact, I thought it would see some resistance, due to so many
    Python-related threading/multiprocessing questions on Stack
    Overflow, such that it might be closed as a duplicate.
-   [This blog post] makes me wanna contribute to LibreOffice, which is
    made even more appealing by fact that I\'m using the language a lot
    [at work].
-   It is a sad fact that for large Python codebases, the pain of
    porting to Python 3 is quite high. Here\'s [an example for Twisted].
-   I am a fan of [argparse], but [this specific CLI parsing library]
    takes an interesting direction.
-   [great web app design advice]
