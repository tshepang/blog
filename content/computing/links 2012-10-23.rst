-  I did not expect `this question of mine`_ to be loved so much. In
   fact, I thought it would see some resistance, due to so many
   Python-related threading/multiprocessing questions on Stack Overflow,
   such that it might be closed as a duplicate.

-  `This blog post`_ makes me wanna contribute to LibreOffice, which is
   made even more appealing by fact that I'm using the language a lot
   `at work`_.

-  It is a sad fact that for large Python codebases, the pain of porting
   to Python 3 is quite high. Here's `an example for Twisted`_.

-  I am a fan of `argparse`_, but `this specific CLI parsing library`_
   takes an interesting direction.

-  `great web app design advice`_
