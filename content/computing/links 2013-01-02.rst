-  Go language looks good for web apps:

   -  `comparison with Python`_
   -  `evaluation after writing some important apps`_
   -  `combines elegance of Python with speed of C/C++`_

-  The Python import system can be `a scary beast`_.

-  I appreciate this `summary of the differences`_ between upstream
   kernel and one included in Debian; would be nice to get more of this,
   and also on other major software included in Debian

-  The `highest-voted answer`_ I ever gave on `Stack Exchange`_.

-  `benefits of systemd`_ according to an Arch Linux developer; one
   thing I appreciate is that this was written by someone other than
   `systemd project leader`_, a controversial figure
