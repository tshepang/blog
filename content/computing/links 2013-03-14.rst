* each feature release of Python comes with a great amount of changes,
  but I was particularly impressed by `those of 3.2`_;
  the latest such release `isn't too shabby either`_

* the all-important factor of success in business... `luck`_

* one interesting way of measuring Python 3 adoption is download numbers:
  `0.8 million out of a total of 2 million`_

* another sad case of Ubuntu diverging from GNOME...
  `Online Accounts`_ (`via`_);
  as the author of that quality post says, they may have good reasons for this;
  but to on the surface, it just looks bad

* `a detailed defense`_ on the choice of technology for Stack Exchange chat
