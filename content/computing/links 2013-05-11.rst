* `Python interpreter finally gets tab completion by default`__;
  to see wide use, this will have to wait for 3.4 release,
  `which will only arrive early 2014`__.

* I submitted `my first bug report for Emacs`__,
  perhaps my first ever to a pure GNU project;
  I say this because GNOME claims to be one, but it's really only by name.

* `Excellent guide on improving Python performance`__;
  it's written with PyPy in mind, but has excellent generic advice.

* I enjoyed `this podcast`__ where Jeff Atwood talks about his new
  project, Discourse__.
