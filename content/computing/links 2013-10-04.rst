* `a nicely summarised survey of fresh Debian contributors`__

* `excellent response to an unpleasant reply`__ - `I admire Michael
  Biebl`__, but don't remember him be this harsh

* I enjoyed watching `Skyfield and 15 Years of Bad APIs`__, a far more
  interesting talk than the earlier `API Design for Library
  Authors`__. The former covers API design only in its 2nd half, and
  the latter is exclusively all API talk. The former is also more
  polished than the latter, both in terms of video editing, and how
  presentable the presentation is.

* `great kudos for (the great) Guido van Rossum`__

* `Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names`__ - interesting
