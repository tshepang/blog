* `A well-written article`__ offering tips on being a good 3D artist

* `an epic battle in improving performance of Debian Code Search`__

* `24 days of Rust`__ is a nice series of 24 posts related to Rust,
  each short and concise, which is the way I like it

* `Why your first FizzBuzz implementation may not work`__
  - a very nice Rust mini-tutorial

* `151-byte static Linux binary in Rust`__ - interesting experiment
