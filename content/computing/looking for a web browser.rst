looking for a web browser
=========================

So Firefox is pretty decent, but it's `AwesomeBar`_ tends to be damn
slow, not to mention the well-known fact of the monster's great
memory-consumption (~200MB VmRSS). Desperate for a better alternative, I
tried the gorgeous Google Chrome for a number of days, and it doesn't
have any equivalent of that killer feature, AwesomeBar, which I've come
to heavily depend on, so I simply left it in a dustbin.

I also played with `Epiphany`_, and worse than its ugly looks is it's
behaviour of launching new windows instead of tabs when I click on links
from GMail is also screwed up, and I couldn't find any configuration to
change it. Even worse is that it does not remember text that I enter in
text forms. Oh, and it doesn't support offline GMail and Google Reader.

Here's how they rate:

1. Firefox
2. Google Chrome
3. Epiphany

It's really time-consuming to play with the browsers (migrating
bookmarks, re-entering passwords since I normally save them, getting
used to a new interface) and I doubt there's anything that comes close
to these three that's available in Debian, unless I'm going to sacrifice
having something that looks out-of-place on my GNOME desktop, like KDE
solutions (to be fair Google Chrome did look out-of-place, but it at
least uses GNOME technologies like GTK+, and won't pull in a bunch KDE
stuff like their daemons that tend to keep running even when the apps
that started them are long killed).
