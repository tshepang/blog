Mercurial is the only version control system that I actually like, and I
do celebrate each time I see a project use it. So, here I list the most
notable projects I am aware of that do, which also gives me hope that it
isn\'t being suffocated too much by Git:

-   [Firefox], world number 3 desktop web browser (number of users)
-   [OpenJDK], the top open source implementation of the Java platform
-   [Netbeans], one of the most popular IDEs

And here is one which is not FLOSS (i.e.Â proprietary):

-   [Facebook], world number 2 website in terms of visitor numbers

  [Firefox]: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
  [OpenJDK]: http://hg.openjdk.java.net
  [Netbeans]: http://wiki.netbeans.org/WorkingWithNetBeansSources#Mercurial_access
