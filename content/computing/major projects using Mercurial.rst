==============================

:tags: VCS
:date: 2014-01-13



Mercurial is the only version control system that I actually like, and
I do celebrate each time I see a project use it. So, here I list the
most notable projects I am aware of that do, which also gives me hope
that it isn't being suffocated too much by Git:

* Facebook__ (proprietary), world number 2 website (number of visitors)

* Firefox__, world number 3 desktop web browser (number of users)

* CPython__, top 10 of most popular programming languages

* Mercurial__, 2nd only to Git in terms of DVCS popularity, though
  maybe lagging by 2 orders of magnitude :(

* OpenJDK__, the top open source implementation of the Java platform

* Sphinx__, documentation generator used in most Python projects

* PyPy__, the fastest implementation of Python

* `Stack Overflow`__ (proprietary), world number 1 website for
  software developers (number of visitors)
