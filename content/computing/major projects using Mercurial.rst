==============================

Mercurial is the only version control system that I actually like, and
I do celebrate each time I see a project use it. So, here I list the
most notable projects I am aware of that do, which also gives me hope
that it isn't being suffocated too much by Git. I ordered them by my
some rough mix popularity and importance:

* Firefox__, on top 3 of all desktop web browsers (number of users)

* CPython__, on top 10 of all programming languages

* Mercurial__, 2nd only to Git in terms of DVCS popularity, though
  maybe lagging by 2 orders of magnitude :(

* OpenJDK__, the top open source implementation of the Java platform

* Sphinx__, documentation generator used in most Python projects

* PyPy__, likely the most exciting development in the entire Python
  ecosystem
