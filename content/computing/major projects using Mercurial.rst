major projects using Mercurial
==============================

:tags: VCS, non-FLOSS, list



Mercurial is the only version control system that I actually like, and
I do celebrate each time I see a project use it. So, here I list the
most notable projects I am aware of that do, which also gives me hope
that it isn't being suffocated too much by Git:

* Firefox__, world number 3 desktop web browser (number of users)

* CPython__ and PyPy__, the most important implementations of a top 10
  popular programming language

* OpenJDK__, the top open source implementation of the Java platform

* Sphinx__, documentation generator used in most Python projects

And here is one which is not FLOSS (i.e. proprietary):

* Facebook__, world number 2 website in terms of visitor numbers
