me loves new Git site design
============================

I really like the `new website design`_ of the Git project (`story`_).
It even gained a nice and fresh icon, replacing the old which looked
like it was created in 1995. Note that `the old one`_ wasn't crap
either, and was already pretty much modern, following the 'simple and
bold' design trend I've witnessed in recent years. I'm jealous it's
better than `that of Mercurial`_, my favorite.
