me loving the Kiln Harmony concept
==================================

I tend to work a lot with both Git and Mercurial,
and to ease the pain of forgetting which I'm using at a given moment,
I created a setup I described on `another post`__.
An even better solution is having all this sorted out on the server side,
so that it doesn't matter which of the two I'm using.
This comes in a form of a product named `Kiln Harmony`__,
which also turns out to be `a complex beast`__ behind-the-scenes.
Would be kool to see a FLOSS implementation of this.
