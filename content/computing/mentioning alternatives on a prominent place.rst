It's an honorable thing to mention alternative and/or competing
technologies on a project website.  It's even more interesting when
this is done on a promiment page. Here's a few of those who do it:

* `Linux Target Image Builder (LTIB)`__

* LinkChecker__ (linked from main page)

* Liferea__

* Gittip__ (project README file)

* vcs__ (a section in the official documentation)
