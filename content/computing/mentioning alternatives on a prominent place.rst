projects mentioning alternatives on a prominent place:

It's an honorable thing to mention alternative and/or
competing technologies on a project website.
It's even more interesting when this is done on the landing
page, and here's a few of those who do it:

* `Linux Target Image Builder (LTIB)`__

* LinkChecker__

* Liferea__

* Gittip__ (project README file)
