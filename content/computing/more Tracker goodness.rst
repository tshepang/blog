more Tracker goodness
=====================

`Tracker`_'s applet has recently received a revamp which, when clicked,
launches Tracker Search Tool instead of displaying the search box.
That's a minor detail considering `the other work`_ included in the 2
recent releases, most especially the option to auto-pause the daemon
when X events (mouse movement, keyboard presses) are taking place, a
feature which helps with system responsiveness. This shit rocks,
absolutely!
