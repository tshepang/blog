I was `given commit access`_ to wajig project, and did a heck of a lot
of clean-ups, and in the process, learning much about unit testing.
I aimed for a comprehensive solution, partly to avoid regressions,
since I intend to do lot of code changes.

I also looked at converting wajig's GUI `from Glade to GtkBuilder`_.
