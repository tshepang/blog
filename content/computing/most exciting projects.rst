most exciting projects

These are what I find to be the most exciting projects, today:

* PyPy__

  It's been alive for over 10 years, but remains among the most
  exciting of all Python projects. I greatly anticipate the stable
  releases of its two most visible sub-projects:

  - `Transactional Memory`__

    An approach the simplifies multi-threaded programming while also
    bypassing the GIL. There is still much to do (for one, it only
    works on 64-bit Linux) and there is no ETA, but there is a rough
    estimate... sometime in 2016 :(

  - `Python 3 support`__

    I can't wait for the completion of this one, the Python 3 port of
    PyPy. It's a better language, and I try to avoid Python 2 if I
    can. `This one looks like it will be done at any moment`__.

* Rust__

  A new programming language meant to replace the likes of C/C++,
  while also claimed to be a technically superior competitor to Go. It
  does not look like there is a date for the first stable release.

* Servo__

  The future replacement of Gecko, the HTML rendering
  engine powering Firefox. It is written in Rust.
