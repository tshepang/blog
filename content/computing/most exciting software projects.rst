most exciting software projects
===============================

:tags: list, non-Python, Python



These are what I find to be the most exciting projects, today:

* Rust__

  A programming language meant to replace C++:
  it has better memory safety, but maintains comparable speed.
  The first stable release is `scheduled for 2015-05-15`__.

* Servo__

  A browser engine written in Rust.
  It is far more aggressive than the leading web engines of today
  (WebKit and Gecko) in terms of making its operations parallel,
  and should therefore be more responsive.
  An ETA for an Alpha release is sometime in 2015,
  but there is a plan to incorporate one of its components into Gecko
  that same year.

* PyPy__

  It's been alive for over 10 years, but remains among the most
  exciting of all Python projects.

  I greatly anticipate the stable release of its most visible
  sub-project, `Transactional Memory`__.  It's an approach that
  simplifies multi-threaded programming while also bypassing the GIL.
  A very rough ETA for a stable release of this sub-project is
  sometime in 2016.
