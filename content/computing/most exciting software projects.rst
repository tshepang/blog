most exciting software projects
===============================

:tags: list, non-Python, Python



These are what I find to be the most exciting projects, today:

* PyPy__

  It's been alive for over 10 years, but remains among the most
  exciting of all Python projects. I greatly anticipate the stable
  releases of its most visible sub-project:

  - `Transactional Memory`__

    An approach the simplifies multi-threaded programming while also
    bypassing the GIL. There is still much to do (for one, it only
    works on 64-bit Linux) and there is no ETA, but there is a rough
    estimate... sometime in 2016 :(

* Rust__

  A new programming language meant to replace the likes of C/C++,
  while also claimed to be a technically superior competitor to Go. It
  does not look like there is a date for the first stable release.

* Servo__

  The future replacement of Gecko, the HTML rendering
  engine powering Firefox. It is written in Rust.

* cryptography__

  Finally, a solution to the ugly (and fragmented) world of Python
  cryptography libraries. It is still very incomplete at the moment.
