most exciting software projects
===============================

:tags: list, non-Python, Python



These are what I find to be the most exciting projects, today:

* Rust__

  A new programming language meant to replace C++:
  memory safety and easier concurrency, while having comparable speed.
  The most optimistic ETA for the first stable release (1.0) is `March 2015`__.

* Servo__

  A possible future replacement of Gecko, the HTML rendering
  engine powering Firefox. It is written in Rust.

* PyPy__

  It's been alive for over 10 years, but remains among the most
  exciting of all Python projects. I greatly anticipate the stable
  release of its most visible sub-project, `Transactional Memory`__.
  It's an approach that simplifies multi-threaded programming while
  also bypassing the GIL. There is no ETA, but a rough estimate is
  sometime in 2016 :(
