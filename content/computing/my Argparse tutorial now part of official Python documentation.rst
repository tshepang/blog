my Argparse tutorial now part of official Python documentation
==============================================================

I am very glad that `a tutorial`_ I started writing over 2 months ago
has finally been added to `the howto section`_ of CPython documentation.
It took a lot of iteration (over 7) in total before finally being
accepted. But even then, it's still not fully satisfactory for me, and I
really hope that someone else with fresh eyes is going to go through all
of it and offer improvements. Even better, I hope people will find it
useful. I know I would have when I started doing argument parsing. I
found `the main module documention`_ overwhelming, and `the very first
example`_ is in fact why I even started writing this tutorial at all, as
is evident on `the relevant issue`_.
