my first code contribution to the CPython project
=================================================

:date: 2011-06-10
:tags: Python



Looking at `the long list`_ of people who have contributed to Python,
you will notice that my name is somewhere. This moment excites me,
considering my deep respect for the project (the only other mega FLOSS
project I have comparable respect for is Debian).

Interestinly, `my patch`_ went through a few iterations before it was
accepted, and even then, with some modifications. It was an eye-opening
experience, and made me learn a little more than I thought I needed to.
Now, I just need to do a few more of these.
