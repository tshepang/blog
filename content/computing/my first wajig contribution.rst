my first wajig contribution
===========================

Due to my love for the application `Quod Libet`_, I have been
contributing a bit to it. But due the complexity of the code, I looked
elsewhere, and found a favorite tool package management tool, `wajig`_,
and was surprised to find that it's not kept in a VCS. Useful as it is,
it's code looks like a collection of hacks, so I started by offering a
PEP-8 fix.

[**a day later**] Inspired by that offer, the `nice guy`_ that founded
the project created a VCS repo for it, and even offered me `commit
rights`_. I was amazed by the trust.
