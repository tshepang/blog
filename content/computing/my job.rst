At work, I help develop and maintain a system that provisions
subscribers on a telco network. The system has 3 levels: UI, middleware,
and the lower-level parts (network, billing, mail). I'm involved in the
middleware part, which is all Java and Java-based technology (Mule,
jBPM). Oracle is the DB used.
