    I always punctuate its disclosure with an outraged "preposterous!".
    Around mid-section, the initial refutation unavoidly morphs into a
    "hmmm, I can see his point.. but it ain't for me. It just doesn't
    jive with my vibes". By the time I've made it to the end, however,
    it is rare indeed that I haven't seen the light, donned the ritual
    sackcloth and ashes, sworn to atone for my sins and to walk the
    straight and narrow [path] from now on.
