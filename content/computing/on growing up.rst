    Martijn Faassen used to ask us "how fast is PyPy" so we decided to
    name an option enabling all optimizations "--faassen". Then
    "--no-faassen" was naturally added too. Later we decided to grow up
    and renamed it to "-O2", and now "-Ojit".

From `a summary of 10 years of PyPy history`_. Amazing energy and
intellectual prowess the project participants possess,
and `a very respectable project`_ at that.
