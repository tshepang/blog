pleasantly surprised by replace-string (Emacs)
==============================================

If you want to replace some string in Emacs, the primary function to
use is **replace-string** (I think). If the strings, 'old' and 'new'
are provided, it will, by default, replace all occurrences, regardless
of case, while also preserving case of whatever 'old' was. It's
magical yes, but who doesn't like some magic once in a while,
especially when it's so convenient... and so sane.
