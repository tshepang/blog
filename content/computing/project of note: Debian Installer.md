I\'ve looked at pretty installers like that of Ubuntu and Fedora, and
they are all very easy and slick. But whenever I install Debian, I
don\'t really see how much harder it is to use, though it\'s a lot
uglier.

Anyways, what triggered this post is the following tit-bit:

In addition, this tool (or rather, a set of tools) also happens to be
rock-solid, and its great reliability and ease-of-use gets admiration
from me on each install\... I\'ve done dozens, with not one instance of
data loss.
