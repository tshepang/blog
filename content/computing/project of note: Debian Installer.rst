project of note: Debian Installer
=================================

I've recently looked at Ubuntu's 10.04 and 10.10 installers, and they
are quite nifty tools, so fresh and gorgeous, and so easy to use that
nobody would dare say "I can't install Linux!". And then I recently
re-installed my Debian system and I don't really see how much harder it
is to use than Ubuntu's (except that it's far uglier, so I guess that
also makes it intimidating).

What triggered this post is my reading of
`an excellent interview of Colin Watson`_, who did great work on that project,
and had this to say about it:

    d-i [Debian Installer] is the very first thing many of our users
    see, and has a huge range of uses, from simple desktop installs to
    massive corporate deployments; it's unspeakably important that it
    works well, and it's a testament to its design that it's been able
    to trundle along without actually very much serious refactoring for
    the best part of five years now.

It also happens to be a rock-solid tool (actually a set of tools),
and its great reliability gets admiration from me on each install
(and I've done dozens, with not one instance of data loss).
