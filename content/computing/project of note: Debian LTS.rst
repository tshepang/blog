project of note: Debian LTS
===========================

One of the complaints about Debian stable releases is that they reach
End Of Life too early (~3 years). This can result in some people
choosing commercially-backed alternatives like Ubuntu and Red Hat, for
they don't want to be bothered to have to upgrade that frequently (not
everyone cares for the latest things, and it's not always practical to
do OS upgrades). That's why the `Debian LTS (Long Term Support)
project`__, which extends the life of a stable to 5 years, excites me.

It's also super-nice that `contributing to it financially`__ is made
damn so easy, thanks to Freexian, a company run by a great Debian
Developer, RaphaÃ«l Hertzog. The project is now a few months old, and
has achieved moderate success (`latest status report`__).
