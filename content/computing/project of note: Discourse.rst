project of note: Discourse
==========================

:date: 2013-05-11
:tags: non-Python, non-Debian, project-of-note



`The announcement`__ by project lead, Jeff Atwood, sold me. This is one
rather incredible guy, a game changer of sorts, most notable for
helping create what is likely `the most important programming resource
on the web`__. So whenever he goes and creates something else, I
naturally do pay attention, and this Discourse__ thing looks amazing,
from by limited usage so far.

I am just jealous that it's written in Ruby, and not Python. I am also
jealous that `the main service runs on Ubuntu, and not Debian`__.
