I\'ve been a satisfied user of Geany, a lightweight IDE, these past few
months:

-   automatically detects if it should auto-indent (EG after a function
    definition in Python)
-   got code-folding
-   can highlight \#include file and open it (on new tab); does not do
    this if it\'s a system file (/usr/include) though
-   got terminal emulator on bottom (though I don\'t use it)
-   can automatically detect tab width (or so it claims)
-   has a usage finder which shows where a given function is called,
    even among multiple files
-   got autosave option as a plugin
-   got file browser option as a plugin (although it does not detect
    filesystem changes, EG when a file is deleted the view is not
    updated to reveal such a change)
-   when space-indent is chosen, backspacing through such behaves as if
    they were tabs which enhances navigability
