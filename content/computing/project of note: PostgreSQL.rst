project of note: PostgreSQL
===========================

:date: 2013-04-04
:tags: project-of-note


It is among those rather quite (in terms of controversy) but highly-respectable
projects. It also looks like no other FLOSS DBMS system compares.
It even bills itself *the most advanced open source database* on
`its main page`__.

I've had great respect for the project for years now,
but what prompted this post is its `2013-04-04 Security Release FAQ`__
(via__), a highly-detailed and thorough explanation of an important
security issue affecting a few of its releases.
Reading this, one gets the idea that it's some serious developers running
the project, and I deeply appreciate.
