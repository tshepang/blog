project of note: PostgreSQL
===========================

:date: 2013-04-04
:tags: project-of-note


Among those rather quite (in terms of controversy) but highly-respectable
projects, it appears there really isn't any FLOSS DBMS system that compares.
It even bills itself *the most advanced open source database* on
`its main page`__.

I've had great honors for the project for years now,
but what prompted this post is its `2013-04-04 Security Release FAQ`__
(via__), a highly-detailed and thorough explanation regarding an important
security issue affecting a few of its releases.
Reading this, one gets the idea that it's some serious developers running
the project, and I deeply appreciate.
