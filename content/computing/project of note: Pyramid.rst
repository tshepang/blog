project of note: Pyramid
========================

If I'm going to have to choose to use any one web framework, it's going
to have to be this one. This is due to being impressed by its `high
development standards`_: 100% documentation coverage, and most
especially (and rare quality), 100% code coverage. What makes that rock
harder is the developers' claimed commitment to those two, as well an
attempt at keeping the design simple.
