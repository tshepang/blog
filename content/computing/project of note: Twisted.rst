project of note: Twisted
========================

I've been impressed by `the claims made for Twisted`_, which erased the
erroneous thought I've been having that it's just another web framework.
Well, it appears it doesn't really have an equal, and is something
completely different.

What prompted me to award it **project of note** honor is its `patch
review process`_, a good indicator that this isn't a toy.
