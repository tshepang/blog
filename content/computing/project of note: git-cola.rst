project of note: git-cola
=========================

I use `git-cola`__ mostly when I want to commit various hunks separately;
it makes that task real easy.

I was impressed by its equivalent functionality for the git
``--amend`` option. If you click on the **Amend Last Commit** radio
button, it actually displays the commit message of that previous commit.
I was surprised to see it, especially since on clicking that option, I
quickly ran to the command-line to copy that commit message, only to see
the message waiting for me, ready to be edited away.

Another feature I really like is that if you attempt to commit something
without staging it first, instead of just complaining, if offers to
*stage and commit* all in one click. Nice.

These functionalities are real simple, but they really make for a
pleasant user experience.

Pity I haven't seen a tool as easy to use in the land of
Mercurial. There, I use the command-line ``hg record`` which isn't as
pleasant.
