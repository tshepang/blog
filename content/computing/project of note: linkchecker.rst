============================

Weeks ago, I looked for a utility that would help me check for my blog's
dead links, and I bumped onto `LinkChecker`_ (version on my system is
6.2). It turned out to be impressively advanced, and here's the summary
from its manpage:

    LinkChecker features recursive checking, multithreading, output in
    colored or normal text, HTML, SQL, CSV or a sitemap graph in GML or
    XML, support for HTTP/1.1, HTTPS, FTP, mailto:, news:, nntp:, Telnet
    and local file links, restriction of link checking with regular
    expression filters for URLs, proxy support, username/password
    authorization for HTTP and FTP, robots.txt exclusion protocol
    support, i18n support, a command line interface and a (Fast)CGI web
    interface (requires HTTP server).
