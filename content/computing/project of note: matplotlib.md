I believe [matplotlib] is THE plotting library for Python. It happens to
be highly advanced too, and has [extensive documentation] to show up for
it, including a large collection [examples] and a [gallery] of plots
(and the code used to produce them).

[I played a bit with it] and [was later on impressed by its
versatility].
