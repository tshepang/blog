project of note: matplotlib
===========================

:tags: project-of-note, Python

I believe `matplotlib`_ is THE plotting library for Python. It happens
to be highly advanced too, and has `extensive documentation`_ to show up
for it, including a large collection `examples`_ and a `gallery`_ of
plots (and the code used to produce them).

`I played a bit with it`_ and `was later on impressed by its
versatility`_.
