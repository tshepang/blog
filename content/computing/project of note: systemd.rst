project of note: systemd

The `great`_ `Lennart Poettering`_ has done it again, rocking the FLOSS
world a bit with his good-looking new init system, systemd. He got `a
lengthy post`_ discussing its design, and what captivated me the most is
his plans to have it replace gnome-session. Reason is that for me the
lesser the daemons we have, the better, and FLOSS technologies are in
desperate need for standard components. This is the sort of thing he is
battling to do with reducing the need for a myriad GNU/Linux audio
technologies, by providing PulseAudio as repalcement.

One of the great problems with Linux-based desktops is integration:
distro devs either have to neglect certain areas (EG, discarding
non-mainstream hardware/software architectures) or go to great pains to
integrate various techs in order to have easy-to-use 'products', and I
think both Ubuntu and Fedora are doing the former while Debian is doing
the latter, hence Debian tends to feel less polished than these others.
