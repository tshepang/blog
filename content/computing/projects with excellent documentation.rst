projects with excellent documentation
=====================================

Here is a list of projects whose documentation I found to be
highly-detailed and well-written:

-  `CPython`_ - I used to appreciate this more before I got closely
   involved, noticing warts here and there, and therefore taking it for
   granted.

-  The `introductory tutorial of GNU Emacs`_ (looks a lot better when
   run from within Emacs), is written in a very gentle and careful way;
   it's among the best tutorials I've seen.

-  `valgrind`_ - its docs properly represent its status as among the most
   respected of FLOSS projects

-  `sqlite3`_ - quite extensive, especially for an embeddable DBMS

-  `Suds`_ - multiple, well-written examples

-  `rdiff-backup usage examples`_ - much smaller than the others listed
   here, but nevertheless deserves mention because it's both gentle and
   thorough


As a sidenote, I've heard great things about `Django's`_, but haven't
really looked yet.
