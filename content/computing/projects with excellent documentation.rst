projects with excellent documentation
=====================================


:tags: list

Here is a list of projects whose documentation I found to be
highly-detailed and well-written.


big
---

- The `introductory tutorial of GNU Emacs`__ (looks a lot better when
  run from within Emacs), is written in a very gentle and careful way;
  it's among the best tutorials I've seen.  Same applies to `the Emacs
  manual`__, which I'm tempted to call the best I've read yet. It
  really, really goes into painstaking detail, and seems to have been
  written by professional technical writers.

- CPython__ - this is quite massive, so although quality is generally
  high, it varies depending on where you are; `an example of
  excellence`__

- sqlite3__ - quite extensive, especially for an embeddable DBMS

small
-----

- Suds__ - multiple, well-written examples

- `rdiff-backup usage examples`__ - much smaller than the others listed
  here, but nevertheless deserves mention because it's both gentle and
  thorough

- While working on giving a product of ours `at work`__ the ability to
  speak SocketCAN__, I really appreciated its `official
  documentation`__. It is very well-written and thorough (though it
  assumes prior knowledge of working with Linux sockets).

As a sidenote, I've heard great things about Django's__, but haven't
really looked yet.
