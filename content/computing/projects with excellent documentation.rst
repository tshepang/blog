projects with excellent documentation
=====================================


:tags: untagged


Here is a list of projects whose documentation I found to be
highly-detailed and well-written.


big
---

- The `introductory tutorial of GNU Emacs`_ (looks a lot better when
  run from within Emacs), is written in a very gentle and careful way;
  it's among the best tutorials I've seen.  Same applies to `the Emacs
  manual`_, which I'm tempted to call the best I've read yet. It
  really, really goes into painstaking detail, and seems to have been
  written by professional technical writers.

- `CPython`_ - I used to appreciate this more before I got closely
  involved, noticing warts here and there, and therefore taking it for
  granted.

- `sqlite3`_ - quite extensive, especially for an embeddable DBMS


small
-----

- `Suds`_ - multiple, well-written examples

- `rdiff-backup usage examples`_ - much smaller than the others listed
  here, but nevertheless deserves mention because it's both gentle and
  thorough


As a sidenote, I've heard great things about `Django's`_, but haven't
really looked yet.
