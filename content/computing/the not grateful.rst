   Unfortunately, my experience has been that most people gloss over the
   philosophical arguments in favour of open source,
   and focus instead on the price,
   viewing open source as a cheap way to fill a software stack.

   -- `Personal funding, and the culture of open source`__

This is sad, but the author should have probably used the term *Free software*,
instead of *open source*... politics vs. convenience.
