========================

:tags: untagged



Following are tools I use all the time, but am not necessarily loving.
For those I like a lot, see `this list`__.

* Debian: my primary OS, and also my favorite
* Emacs: general text editor
* Vim: it happens to be installed on a lot of systems at work, but I
  only rarely use it on my workstation

* GNOME: primary Desktop Environment

  - gnome-panel
  - gnome-search-tool
  - gnome-system-monitor
  - nautilus
  - file-roller

* Evince: PDF reading
* Quod Libet: audio player
* Thunderbird: I prefer Evolution, but it gave me some issues I don't remember
* GNU toolchain (GCC, make, GLibC, ...)
* VLC
* Git
* Mercurial
