tools I use all the time
========================

:tags: untagged



Following are tools I use all the time, but am not necessarily loving.
For those I like a lot, see `this list`__.

* **Debian**: my primary OS, and also my favorite
* **Emacs**: general text editor
* **Vim**: it happens to be installed on a lot of systems at work, but I
  only rarely use it on my workstation

* **GNOME**: primary Desktop Environment

  - gnome-panel
  - gnome-search-tool
  - gnome-system-monitor
  - nautilus
  - file-roller

* Liferea__: would not be using this had it not been for Google Reader
  shutdown, but am glad they did cuz I like the tool, ugly and unkool
  as it is
* **Evince**: I would love to get a PDF reader with better navigation
* **Quod Libet**: audio player
* **Thunderbird**: I prefer Evolution, but it gave me some issues I don't remember
* **GNU toolchain** (GCC, make, GLibC, ...)
* **VLC**: ugly interface, solid application
* **Git**: do I have a choice?
* **Mercurial**: my favorite
