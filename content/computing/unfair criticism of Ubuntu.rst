unfair criticism of Ubuntu
==========================

    The developers who castigate Ubuntu are uniformly silent about the
    number of kernel patches coming from the Mandriva camp. They have
    nothing to say about how much Xandros gives back to Debian. Nobody
    totals up contributions from Gentoo. There are no complaints about
    Slackware's presence in the community. Arch Linux developers do not
    hear that they are not doing enough. There are no high-profile
    articles on how rPath is taking advantage of free software
    developers.
