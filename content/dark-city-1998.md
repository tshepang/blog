Innovative story concept, excellent elements (direction, cinematography,
production design), ultra-desirable woman (Jennifer Connelly), impressive
make-up (The Strangers), and an interesting eccentric character played
by Kiefer Sutherland. The Strangers are given good performances, most
especially the one leading the search.

Despite all the goodness, the experience is marred by some shortcuts
taken by the writers, some continuity errors, an uninteresting lead, and
some bad visual effects, most evidently in the laughable final showdown.
