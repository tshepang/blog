I found this the most fun (lots and lots of good humor) of all superhero
movies I've yet seen. I'm also tempted to call it the best, but a
revisit is required before dethroning [Iron Man] from that position. I
find it the most daring (the vulgarity), and has a great number of movie
firsts. In addition, the action direction is superb, and so are the
visual effects. The movie also offers some of the most delicious
instances of Breaking the Fourth Wall. I am also glad that the character
of Colossus (man of metal) was changed... the X-Men movies did a bad
job with theirs.

Complaints:

-   I wish the romantic interest was less of an action hero herself,
    just to lend a bit of realism, as well as avoiding the
    super-annoying formula.
-   Near the end of the movie, tough lady simply disappears without
    explanation.
