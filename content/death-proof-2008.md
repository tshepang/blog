Kurt Russel gives a good performance, and I don't remember enjoying any
of his others. Quentin Tarantino reprises the style he used so well in
*Pulp Fiction*: lengthy and pointless dialogues that mostly do nothing
to serve the story (and deliberately so I suspect), but nevertheless
interesting, and perhaps the one thing that made people fall in love
with this director.

The cast of the first of the 2 stories found in *Death Proof* is top-rate,
and the handling of the material helps the piece feel real fresh. Oh,
and it also got the best (and most gruesome) car crash in recent memory.
