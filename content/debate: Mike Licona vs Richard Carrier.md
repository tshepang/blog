I recently listened to a 2.5 hour-long [debate] between two scholars,
[Richard Carrier] and [Mike Licona], which alerted me to the fact that
Jesus' Resurrection is regarded, at least to Christian apologists, to
be very central to the Christian faith (here's [an unsatisfactory
review]). I became far more impressed with Richard's performance than
Mike's:

-   Mike was the only one who displayed some arrogance (a silly joke
    here and a chuckle there, unsuccessfully forcing his opponent to use
    the word delusion instead of hallucination, etc.).
-   Richard was more convincing (and the knowledge he displayed of this
    topic is mind-numbing).
-   He was more clear with his arguments.
-   He was seemingly more prepared (his opponent probably thought he was
    going to be a walkover).
-   Mike was a bit embarassing at times when mentioning The Passion of
    Christ, especially the time when he was praising Jesus (I cringed a
    bit there), and Richard, by the way, ignored references to that
    movie.

Based on these points, I vote for Richard as the winner, with the
disclaimer that the latter part of the debate was getting too technical
for me to follow thoroughly.

**sidenotes**:

-   See [Luke Muehlhauser]'s [well-argued take] on the issue of the
    Resurrection.
-   Luke's blog, [Common Sense Atheism] ([praise]), apparently has [the
    largest collection of links to atheist vs theist debates] and is
    therefore a great resource.
