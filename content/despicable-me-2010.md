The were moments of good humor (e.g. when lead character was stealing
the shrinking machine), but much of the time, the whole thing is
irritating; the writers worked hard at making this child-friendly (e.g.
being hit multiple missiles results only in a sad face covered in
smoke); the excessively-advanced gadgets are nice.
