Debian got so many people doing what seem like thankless jobs in an
effort to improve it. One of those guys is Alexander Reichle-Schmehl
(look at my struggling tongue), who has for a number of months been
pushing an initiative to fix a bunch of RC bugs weekly ([example]). This
developer has been busy [keeping track of RC bug counts], reducing the
need for me to go check myself.
