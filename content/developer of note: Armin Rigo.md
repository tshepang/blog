What inspired this post (originally published 2013-03-31) is the
incredible honor given by the great Raymond Hettinger in [one of his
PyCon US 2013 talks], where he deems him "probably the smartest person
I have ever met". Given that there isn't a shortage of brilliance in
the Python community, that's some serious kudos.

Also, here is what one of speakers at that conferences said:

> ... Armin Rigo is awesome - he's perhaps the only incredibly
> intelligent person involved with programming I've met who seemed
> genuinely happy about life (and not grumpy at all).
