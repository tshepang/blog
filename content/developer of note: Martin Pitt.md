I suspect that [PostgreSQL] isn't a trivial piece of software, and I
consider it among the greatest of all FLOSS. It even bills itself the
most advanced of all FLOSS databases. That's what brought [Martin Pitt]
to my attention, for he is it's Debian (and now also Ubuntu)
maintainer. One other notable thing about him is his quiet persona (I
follow Debian development fairly closely, and I don't remember seeing
him take part in any of the arguments in its mailing lists). I only ever
notice him when he'd give [some random][] [status update].
