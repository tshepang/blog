So I really do honor all Debian Developers especially when they are
named [Michael Biebl]. This guy is the lone maintainer of [Tracker] and
rsyslog in Debian (among others). Not just that but he is also a
co-maintainer of a large number of GNOME technologies (gnome-session,
dbus, avahi, gnome-power-manager, gvfs, hal, network-manager\...).

I love especially his role as some sorta QA for Tracker (he\'s done a
terrific job of it +++ most recently offering [a bunch of patches] to
fix some linking problems in the code). Oh, and I\'m not the only one
who noticed +++ [the great Josselin Mouette], [did offer accolades too]
for Michael\'s other work.
