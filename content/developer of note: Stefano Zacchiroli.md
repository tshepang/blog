I admire [this guy] a lot:

-   his great passion for Debian (he speaks on behalf of it on a variety
    of events)
-   mature and thoughtfulness in a variety of debates regarding this or
    that decision within Debian
-   his ongoing push for collaboration between Debian and other distros
-   his positive outlook for Debian, at a time when many are worried
    about its loss of relevance
-   his passion for software freedom (we need people like this in an age
    where people tend to trade freedom for pragmatism)

To prove I\'m not the only one, there a bunch more guys who were happy
enough with his 2010 term as Debian Project Leader (DPL), that they
re-elected him again. What\'s more interesting is that no one else stood
for election. He also won the term [the third time], so will reign over
Debian in 2012.
