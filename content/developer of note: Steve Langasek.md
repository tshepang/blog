Steve Langasek has been Debian release manager for over two years and
always managed to impress me with his technical knowledge of Debian
packaging as well as relentless effort into getting this, the Debian
system, into a releasable operating system. He is the definitive Debian
watchdog, for I often pay attention when it's his turn to talk on
mailing lists, and he also happens to be among the most powerful of all
DD's (for it's said that Debian release managers tend to be more
powerful than Debian project leaders). Grandmaster!
