[Vinay Sajip] is the maintainer of [logging], a Python logging
library/module, available in the standard library. What prompted this
post is his tireless improvements, not just to the software itself, but
also the documentation surrounding it ([example]). It\'s all the more
impressive that he continuously blogs about various ways to use the
module, and maintains [a bunch of nuggets on advanced usage].

One early event, which is likely the first time I noticed him, is the
time when he rebutted some apparently inaccurate claims against the
module, at which he responded in a [highly-detailed post], which that
lent credence to the module. This inspired me to give it a try, and
[it\'s not that hard].

There\'s one other project he works on, [sarge], which is like
[subprocess] on steroids. Have a look at [why he created it].

Lately, he is working on [distlib], a library which implements low-level
functions that relate to packaging and distribution of Python software.
This excites me a lot since it\'s a key piece in the latest attempt at
fixing Python packaging once and for all.

On top of all this, he is very active on Stack Overflow, having answered
[hundreds of questions] there. Amazing!
