In celebration of the beginning of this exercise, I recognize Aurelien
Jarno as a very notable developer. This is due to his tireless efforts
as the number one GLibC co-maintainer in Debian since several months (if
the package's debian changelog is to be relied upon). Also, GLibC,
together with GCC and Linux, ought to be regarded as the most important
packages of any GNU/Linux system.
