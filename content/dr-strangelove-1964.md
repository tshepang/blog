This is one of the rare old black & white movies that are actually
enjoyable throughout; it's always a pleasure to revisit. The movie's
greatest triumphs are it's characters and performances, best of which
is Sterling Hayden as the mad general. One bonus performance is the guy
who is concerned about destroying property of the Coca Cola Company; and
he didn't even look the idiot he was.

The attention-to-detail, regarding the procedures the guys in the bomber
plane follow, is impressive; the dialog is incredible.
