It is reasonably entertaining, the animation is sophisticated, and
visual design is of good quality, but it suffers from relying too much
on recycled material, most notably from *The Incredibles* and
[Megamind]. I must not fault it too much for its direction, which is
also typical of so many expensive 3D-animated movies, including the
above-mentioned ones. Even the character design is not fresh, though I
did like one character... the giant gal. She is also not an original
concept (see Eva in [Igor]), but then again I'm a sucker for misfits
like this.
