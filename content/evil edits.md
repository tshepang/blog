It gets disgusting when re-releases, usually in a form of 'the best of
X', gets their tracks' lengths reduced, all to make space for a larger
number of tracks on that album. The worst such a situation is in the
case of Don't Leave Me This Way (Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes) which
had a release that cut it to about 5 minutes of its original 10 minutes,
effectively getting rid of the most exciting part of that track, the
climactic second act. A similar thing happened to Brenda Fassie's
Weekend Special whose climax was also mercilessly cut in her Greatest
Hits album.
