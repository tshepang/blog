The squabbling and delegation of decision-making seen in the movie was
most entertaining, and also unique in my movie-watching experience,
complete with high-tension and interesting debates. The most admirable
character is the guy who operates the insect-sized drone.

I am, however, sad due to some of the shortcuts taken, all regarding the
country the movie is set in:

-   The movie is set in Kenya, but there's way too many South African
    actors, a fact that could perhaps be forgiven since filming took
    place in that country
-   I am told that the unhygienic handling of bread doesn't happen in
    Kenya
-   No terrorist organisation controls any part of Kenya
