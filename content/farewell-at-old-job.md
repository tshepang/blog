I was yesterday honored with a farewell party at my company, at which I
worked as integration technician (opto-electro-mechanical engineering
industry) for nearly five years. And there was even chocolates for me to
take home with, while having people throwing accolades at me like I was
sort of useful... I really should be thankful for the accomodation (and
monies) I was granted and am excited for [the next challenge].
