I don\'t like the default [Pelican] theme, `notmyidea`:

-   It is decent, but the post metadata feels cramped where its placed.
-   The is no visible link to tags, never-mind a tag cloud (which is
    handy).
-   I just don\'t like the general look.

So, I had a look at the others:

[Elegant]
=========

This the least static-like of all themes I\'ve seen yet which makes it
the most innovative. The search feature, which sets it apart from its
competitors, got me excited.

It has some issues though ([to be fixed at some point]):

-   ignores Twitter setting
-   RSS feeds are supported, but the icons aren\'t made visible

It\'s also not the prettiest of themes, but it will have to do, at least
for now.

I was impressed enough that I was strongly considering settling for this
one, despite the following issues:

-   no Tags on individual Posts
-   no Categories on individual Posts
-   [it doesn\'t display bullets]!

[monospace]
===========

-   \[**win**\] simple and elegant design
-   \[**win**\] displays pages as a list, all but the newest one in the
    view
-   \[**win**\] me loving the Archives view
-   Categories are not shown in a prominent place (e.g. menu bar)
-   no Tags on individual Posts
-   no Categories on individual Posts
-   ignores Twitter setting
-   Post titles are capitalised (minor issue)

[Just Read]
===========

-   \[**win**\] elegant and simple design (**my favorite of all**)
-   \[**win**\] displays pages as a list, all but the newest one in the
    view
-   Categories are 2nd-class citizens: they aren\'t shown on the index
    page
-   bullets are done wrong: the bullet-ed text is not indented
-   on post view, there is no distinction between Tags and Categories
-   too much border space on code snippets (**pre** tag?)
-   background for code snippets is not distinctive

[tuxlite\_tbs]
==============

-   \[**win**\] clean and simple design: nice menu-bar and sidebars
-   tags aren\'t shown along-aside posts

[Mockingbird]
=============

-   \[**win**\] very nice and clean design
-   date on Archives looks like shit
-   background for code snippets is not distinctive
-   Categories only visible on individual Posts
-   ignores Twitter setting
-   does not support Disqus

[neat]
======

-   \[**win**\] the look is different; it feels calm
-   Archives view is not ideal, though it\'s not in a prominent location
-   Categories are not shown in a prominent place (e.g. on menu bar)
-   when [custom fields] are not specified, they are handled in a naive
    manner:

    ![naive handling of unspecified custom fields]

[Chunk]
=======

-   \[**win**\] a trendy look
-   oversized text, especially blog title
-   background for code snippets is not distinctive
-   Archives look like shit
-   ignores Twitter setting

[Bootstrap 2]
=============

-   \[**win**\] the Menu bar is unbeatable
-   the general look is too busy:
    -   the Categories and Tags on the right must go
    -   who wants snippets on posts
    -   showing Category and Tag on main views
-   separate tag cloud page missing
-   line length too long
