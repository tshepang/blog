The laptop that [I previously mentioned] is named Compaq/HP nx7010 and
is the most favorite I've ever used (despite that it's only the second
laptop I've ever used heavily). I suspect I like it mostly because of
the feel of the keyboard, and its 1.7GHz Pentium M is really more than
adequate for the modest tasks I throw at it; and its only set-back is
the placement of the 3 USB ports - at the back. It's a pity that I'll
have to leave it behind since [I'm changing jobs]. I also use an
external USB mouse, which also enhances the experience. [[update]]
