I like these companies a lot, for they appear transparent,
leading me to trust them.

- [Ferrous Systems], which offers Rust consulting and training,
  also does a lot for the language in the embedded domain by running [Oxidise].
  That, combined with having Jorge Aparicio work for them,
  makes them the most visible name in that domain for Rust.
  I am also excited for [their effort][Sealed Rust] in helping Rust get to be
  certified for use in Safety Critical systems.

- [Mullvad], which offers a VPN service,
  develop their tools [in public] (open source),
  and Rust features a lot in those.
  Reading through their site leaves me impressed about how
  serious they are about security and privacy.

- [Oxide], which builds servers (early stage, nothing shipping yet),
  also makes heavy use of Rust as well as open source firmware.
  Best of all, [all workers get the same salary]!

- [Cloudflare], which offers various internet services,
  offers many of them without a fee.
  The one I use is their DNS service, with a promise of speed and privacy.
  Also impressive is their blog posts,
  which are both detailed and numerous.
  A number of them [have to do with Rust],
  for they use the language to develop some of their tools.
