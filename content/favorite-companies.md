I like these companies a lot for they appear transparent,
leading me to trust them.

- [Mullvad], which offers a VPN service,
  develop their tools [in public] (open source),
  and Rust features a lot in those.
  Reading through their site leaves me impressed about how
  serious they are about security and privacy.

- [Cloudflare], which offers various internet services,
  offers many of them without a fee.
  The one I use is the DNS service, with a promise of speed and privacy.
  Also impressive is their blogs posts,
  which are both detailed and numerous.
  A number of them [have to do with Rust],
  for they use the language to develop some of their tools.
