I like these companies a lot, for they appear transparent,
leading me to trust them.

- [Ferrous Systems], which offers Rust consulting and training,
  also does a lot for the language in the embedded domain by running [Oxidise].
  That, combined with having Jonathan Pallant in their employ
  (and previously Jorge Aparicio and James Munns),
  makes them the most visible name in that domain for Rust.
  I am also excited for [Ferrocene],
  which is their effort in getting Rust to be used in
  "Safety-critical sectors, such as automotive, railway, and aerospace".

- [Mullvad], which offers a VPN service,
  develop their tools [in public] (open source),
  and Rust features a lot in those.
  Reading through their site leaves me impressed about how
  serious they are about security and privacy.

- [Oxide], which builds servers (early stage, nothing shipping yet),
  also makes heavy use of Rust as well as open source firmware.
  Best of all, [all workers get the same salary]!

- [Fastly], which offers various internet services,
  is a key player in the Wasm ecosystem,
  as evidenced by employing giants such as [Alex Crichton] and [Dan Gohman].
