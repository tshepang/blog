Here are some reasons why I like some companies a lot:
- how they appear to be managed
- what they build
- their Rust embrace

Here goes, and they need not show strongly in all of the 3 reasons above...

- [Ferrous Systems], which offers Rust consulting and training,
  also does a lot for the language in the embedded domain by running [Oxidize].
  That, combined with having Jonathan Pallant and Jorge Aparicio in their employ
  (and James Munns previously),
  makes the company the most visible name in that domain for Rust.
  I am also excited for [Ferrocene],
  which is their effort in getting Rust to be used in
  "Safety-critical sectors, such as automotive, railway, and aerospace".

- [Igalia],
  an open source consultancy company most visible in open source web browser work
  (they make large contributions to all 3 major browser engines),
  also happens to be a worker cooperative.
  As is the case with such organisation kinds,
  all workers are involved in business decisions,
  and they also get the same pay.
  They recently began re-igniting the development of Servo,
  a project that pioneered a number of browser components written in Rust,
  some of which are now included in Firefox.

- [Mullvad], which offers a VPN service,
  develop their tools [in public] (open source),
  and Rust features a lot in those.
  Reading through their site leaves me impressed about how
  serious they are about security and privacy.

- [Oxide], which builds server racks,
  also makes heavy use of Rust as well as open source firmware.
  Best of all, [all workers get the same pay]!

- [Fastly], which offers various internet services,
  is a key player in the Wasm ecosystem,
  as evidenced by employing giants such as [Alex Crichton] and [Dan Gohman].
