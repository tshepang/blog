These are some reasons why I like some companies a lot:
- how they appear to be managed
- what they build
- their Rust embrace

Here goes, and they need not show strongly in all of the 3 reasons above...

- [Embark Studios],
  a gamedev company,
  is probably the most kool of companies that embrace Rust...
  they care deeply about the Rust ecosystem,
  which includes developing open source tooling for it,
  and helping to funding many open source contributors and projects.
  What makes them the most kool is the games they develop...
  they got some mouth-watering teasers and concept art
  (for the upcoming 2 games, [The Finals] and [Arc Raiders]).

- [Ferrous Systems], which offers Rust consulting and training,
  also does a lot for the language in the embedded domain by running [Oxidise].
  That, combined with having Jonathan Pallant in their employ
  (and previously Jorge Aparicio and James Munns),
  makes them the most visible name in that domain for Rust.
  I am also excited for [Ferrocene],
  which is their effort in getting Rust to be used in
  "Safety-critical sectors, such as automotive, railway, and aerospace".

- [Mullvad], which offers a VPN service,
  develop their tools [in public] (open source),
  and Rust features a lot in those.
  Reading through their site leaves me impressed about how
  serious they are about security and privacy.

- [Oxide], which builds servers (early stage, nothing shipping yet),
  also makes heavy use of Rust as well as open source firmware.
  Best of all, [all workers get the same salary]!

- [Fastly], which offers various internet services,
  is a key player in the Wasm ecosystem,
  as evidenced by employing giants such as [Alex Crichton] and [Dan Gohman].
