- [clap]:
  I consider this one of the killer libs in the Rust ecosystem...
  there is good taste in terms of design,
  it is comprehensive,
  and it has a very pleasant way of using it,
  the derive API.

- [serde]:
  This one seems to get even more praise (compared to [clap]),
  and is perhaps as good as anything in other language ecosystems in its domain,
  especially with its derive API (as is the case with clap).
