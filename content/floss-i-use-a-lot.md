### environment

- __Debian__: my primary OS, and also my favorite
- __Android__: for all my mobile needs
- __Emacs__: pleasant text editing and file management
- __fish__: compared to mighty Bash, it is far more pretty,
- [zellij]: pleasant terminal multiplexer
   and has a far better command completion system
- [Alacritty]
- __nm-applet__: part of NetworkManager

### software development

- __Emacs__: acts as a decent IDE
- __Git__: this one has won the mindshare
- __Cargo__: central tool for Rust development

### GUI applications

- __Firefox__ (on Debian and on Android)
- [AntennaPod]: for listening to podcasts (on Android)
- [Transmission]: the only torrent client I have ever used
- __VLC__: user interface could be a lot better

### network diagnosis
- [vnstat]: nifty network usage viewer
- __ping__: checks general reachability
- __mtr__: interactive traceroute tool

### miscellaneous tools

- __apt__: Debian package management
- __head__ and __tail__: included in GNU coreutils suite of tools
- __OpenSSH__: duh!
- [Sudo]: another duh!
- [ripgrep]: a more pleasant `grep`
- [exa]: a more pleasant, more pretty `ls`
- [bat]: a more pleasant, more fancy `cat`, which also supplants `less`
  (though it actually makes use of the latter for paging through long text)
- __top__: a powerful and flexible process viewer, part of [procps suite]
- [openfortivpn]: to connect to work VPN
- [mdBook]: lightweight documentation system,
  using it for work  documentation,
  as well as for Cargo and [rustc-dev-guide] documentation
  (and always served with `mdbook serve`).
- [zola]: for this blog, also always served (with `zola serve`)
