### environment

- **Debian**: my primary OS, and also my favorite
- [zellij]: pleasant terminal multiplexer
- **Emacs**: pleasant text editing and file management
- **fish**: compared to mighty Bash, it is far more pretty,
   and has a far better command completion system
- **nm-applet**: part of NetworkManager

### software development

- **Cargo**: central tool for Rust development
- **Git**: this one has won the mindshare

### GUI applications

- [Alacritty]
- **Firefox** (on Debian and on Android)
- [Transmission]: the only torrent client I have ever used
- **VLC**: user interface could be a lot better
- [AntennaPod]: for listening to podcasts, on Android

### network diagnosis
- [vnstat]: nifty network usage viewer
- **ping**: checks general reachability
- **mtr**: interactive traceroute tool

### miscellaneous tools

- **apt**: Debian package management
- **head** and **tail**: included in GNU coreutils suite of tools
- **OpenSSH**: duh!
- [Sudo]: another duh!
- [ripgrep]: a more pleasant `grep`
- [exa]: a more pleasant, more pretty `ls`
- [bat]: a more pleasant, more fancy `cat`, which also supplants `less`
  (though it actually makes use of the latter for paging through long text)
- **top**: a powerful and flexible process viewer, part of [procps suite]
- [openfortivpn]: to connect to work VPN
- [mdBook]: lightweight documentation system,
  using it for work  documentation,
  and for Cargo and [rustc-dev-guide] documentation
  (which is always served with `mdbook serve`).
- [zola]: for this blog, also always served (with `zola serve`)
