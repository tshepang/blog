A notable element from this movie is the performance of the lead by Ryan
Gosling, who is sort of like a hit from nowhere since I haven't seen
him before. Yet another notable element is the sophisticated and
humorous dialogue, though the script itself falls short near the end,
incapable of justifying various activities done by the villain.
Fortunately there wasn't any formulaic non-sense common in movies.

The story proved a bit sketchy and not so brilliant on second look,
while Rosamund Pike remains a goddess, while Anthony Hopkins pulls off a
great and effortless performance.
