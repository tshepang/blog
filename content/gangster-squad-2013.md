Mireille Enos, who plays the wife, gives a really nice performance. Sean
Penn, on the other hand, gives the worst of his career, perhaps due to
the shitty make-up and bad character development. The movie starts off
well, with the superbly-made heroic antics of the Josh Brolin character,
complete with excellent cinematography and production design. But soon
after, it feels like a failed attempt at an [L.A. Confidential], and got
unfunny humor and misguided romance.
