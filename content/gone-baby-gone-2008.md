Nearly a year after the initial viewing, I am a bit puzzled why I was so
impressed so much by this movie. It remains good, yes, but I went too
far by praising its direction, acting and cast, or even drawing
parallels with [Se7en]!

One thing I got right though was the twist:

As always, I was afraid a revisit would disappoint, especially because
this was the remaining movie I labeled [excellent] in the entire year of
2012... it was going to be the best movie of the year. Sadly, not one
movie from that year went beyong the [very good] (7/10) rating.
