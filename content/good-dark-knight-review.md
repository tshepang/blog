I just read [a real good Dark Knight review], which does a good job of
explaining the complex topic(s) the movie attempts as well as the superb
The Joker, in better words [than I could manage].

Perhaps equally good is [a hater review] from the same publication, and
happens to be more quotable:

> This is a pulp experience that goes on and on and on, with the tired
> assumption that length connotes depth, and somber tones +++ and the
> occasional cackle +++ inject relevance and insight into an
> adolescent's approach to morality and ethics.

That quotable review by the way got comments which really deserves
checking out, and among my favorites:

> The thing that ruined the movie for me was all that impenetrable
> jingoistic bullshit about who was a hero and who needs a hero and what
> kind of hero, and who gives a shit? That and the bullshit about the
> noble people not blowing each other up. Both boats would have blown up
> at once with everybody diving for the trigger, yelling, "Me first!
> Fuck you!" Just like the Joker thought. What a lousy move for a great
> character to get stuck in.
