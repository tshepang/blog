Here's what a revisit felt like, back in 2010:

> It didn't pack as much of a punch as before. It even felt barren.

I was hoping that the third viewing would be more pleasant, but it's
still the same as the second. It is sad because I really enjoyed this
movie on first viewing. It remains an important movie of course, not to
mention being the best David Straithairn moment yet. The camerawork is
also simple, yet effective.
