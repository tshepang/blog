Another Tarantino copycat, perhaps the worst I've seen yet. Michael
Madsen sucks because he does the same performance he always gives (since
[Reservoir Dogs]) and so does Dennis Hopper. The slow pacing is nearly
unbearable, and the smart-ass dialogue is just not as good as Tarantino
can make it. Interestingly, Tarantino lend his name to the movie
(*Tarantino presents...*). Seems like he's not easily embarassed.
