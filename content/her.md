The movie is beautifully-shot, well-edited, and has an exciting concept.
On first viewing, the experience of the first 30 minutes or so was so
magical that I was led to think this may turn out to be at least
excellent. Sadly that wasn't the case: feels like the writer didn't
know where to take the story, or even how to end it. The direction style
feels similar to [Tree of Life], only a lot less experimental, and a lot
more entertaining. A revisit resulted in something that felt rather thin
and boring.

My favorite performance is that of Olivia Wilde. I've only enjoyed her
once before, [In Time], and I've seen her in a few other places as
well, most notably the good-to-excellent TV series, *House*. In all
that, she has never been this good (see the heartbreak moment), and this
desirable. It's also a brief performance, a fact that's probably in
her favor, given she's not the most excellent of actors.
