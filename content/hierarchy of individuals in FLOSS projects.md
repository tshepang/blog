From top to bottom:

1.  Author

    Sometimes referred to as primary author, to distinguish between
    other people who have contributed to the project, this is the
    creator. At times, someone in the lower ranks of the hierarchy
    happen to be more active in the project than the Author, in which
    case the Author often makes them Maintainer, explicitly or not.

2.  Maintainer

    This is someone ultimately responsible for the project: handles bug
    reports, decides which changes to accept from lower contributors,
    and performs releases. Note that there can be more than one, unlike
    is the case with Author.

3.  Contributor

    This is someone who submits improvements to project, either
    documentation or code. It can be a one-time contribution, but in
    case where this is frequent and spans a certain amount of time, she
    can move onto becoming a Maintainer.

4.  Bug Reporter

    This is someone who suggests improvements to the project. Depending
    on the project, any of these are used: a mailing list, an IRC
    channel, a social networking service, email, or a dedicated
    Issue/Bug tracking system can be used.

5.  User

    What the user is depends on the project, of course. Just to be
    clear, in the case of Python project, the user is a software
    developer, not the person who ends up using something written in the
    language.

The \'individual\' in title means I\'m ignoring non-human entities, like
companies. I\'m also ignoring non-core activities, like marketers or
sysadmins, or even teachers. Those are not going to be easy to fit in
this simple story, and are not common to that many FLOSS (Free/Libre and
Open Source) projects.

In the case of [wajig], I am the Maintainer and Graham Williams is the
Author. In the case of [paramiko], a far more important project, [Jeff
Forcier is the Maintainer]. The project was however created by [Robey
Pointer], and [he did not imagine] it would end up being THE Python SSH
library today.
