If you put a few people in a hole in which they can't escape, and
provide only water for a month, what would they do? The movie covers the
concept and quite effectively at that, with the ending, the sort I
normally don't like in horror movie, quite satisfying. Oh, they do end
up eating each other. I kept thinking I'd rather die, but maybe that's
because I don't know the pain of hunger. But screws that, I'd commit
suicide first. That seems an easier solution.

The movie is very low-budget and feels like its made by students, but
the acting is quite good. It would have benefited from decent
cinematography.
