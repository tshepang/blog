Some curious questions I would ask to anyone that uses Rust seriously.

What is...

- the one crate you wish would get more dev attention?
- the one toolchain[^1] feature you want stabilized?
- the one toolchain[^1] change you would like to see happen?
- the one service you would like to see improved?

My own answers:

- dotenv
- `rustdoc-scrape-examples`
- unified toolchain executable
- the web UI that is <https://crates.io>... slow and ugly

[^1]: rustup, rustc, cargo, rustdoc, and clippy
