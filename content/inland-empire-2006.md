Excessively bizarre, and disturbing at times I couldn't figure what the
fuck the story is about; the whole is unbearable, and the experience is
made worse by it's 3hr length. How can people get away with so much
audience torture? Worse still, there are mainstream critics who called
it *brilliant*. What did I miss?
