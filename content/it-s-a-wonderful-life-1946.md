It's sprinkled with some fun moments and interesting performances, but
I cannot forgive some of its shallow writing, especially the fantasy
moments near the end.

There's one especially gorgeous woman (the wife), and one especially
desirable one (the seductive near-lover). The lead has his moments,
though his character's self-importance is often annoying, though it was
probably interesting to audiences of the time.

My favorite performace is by the lady playing Miss "Could I have
1750?" Davis, though it's a very small role, lasting just a few
seconds. That performance also feels out of place in the movie of this
age... it feels a lot more modern.
