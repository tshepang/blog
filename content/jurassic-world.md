Though the story is shallow and full of shortcuts, the movie is very
enjoyable and got lots of exciting moments. [Chris Pratt], whose appeal
surprised me in *Guardians of the Galaxy*, also gives a nice performance
here, though none tops the humorous one of [Irrfan Khan]. I was also
pleased to see [Omar Sy] again (saw him first time in *Good People*).
