I watched this only due to the presence of [Chiwetel Ejiofor], who
provides what's easily the movie's most interesting performance. The
movie's climax is rather outrageous, and bordering on embarrassing. The
movie remains a worthy addition to those which criticize oppression
based on gender. This Chiwetel guy is also kinda pretty.
