One of the most entertaining I have seen yet, I couldn't get enough of
it since I've done numerous repeats of my favorite scenes. It's a
showcase of tremendous (albeit underutilized) talent, but there's also
many scenes and characters which should have been excluded. Anyways,
much of what one sees in here is simply stuff of dreams. Example: we
have a man catching a speeding bullet with great ease, a very
unsuspecting man at that, and dressed in pyjamas and the cheapest of
sandals, and he soon meets his match... I don't know if gets
more exciting than that.

Sadly, the movie is very uneven (there are both very badly-made and very
well-made parts), and looks like it suffers from a low budget. The good
parts:

-   The grand entrance of the world's top killer, complete with the
    bullet moment, the opening of the wall, and the conversation he
    enjoys before starting a fight with the couple. His is the most
    interesting performance (and character) in the whole movie.
-   The moments involving the musical killers. The concept is brilliant
    and very fresh, and the characters are very interesting, especially
    the thin one.
-   I loved the performance of the guy playing the elastic master. He
    was not the sort you'd take seriously (ever so drunk, and grinning
    like he was abnormal), but that perception would quickly change when
    he was forced to get violent.
-   Of the three warriors in the poor part of town, Pig Sty Alley, I
    loved the food maker and the dressmaker. Of these, the dressmaker
    was the most interesting, while also giving the better performance.
    Look out for the brief moment when they spar together before
    parting. Beautiful. You will wish there was more of a backstory to
    these characters.
