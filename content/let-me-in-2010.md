An exercise in embarrassment. [The first novel-to-movie adaptation] was
released only 2-3 years before. I thought they wanted to offer something
else, maybe a budget, with some visual flair. But there's nothing. In
fact there is an uninteresting [Elias Koteas] as the investigator (there
was basically none in the earlier movie), and the companion of the
vampire (played by an extremely uninteresting [Richard Jenkins], who
bored me horrendously in [*Eat Pray Love*]). But these greedy
motherfuckas just wanted to exploit a good story, and give nothing in
return. In fact, the even got lazy, walking briskly over material that
was dealth with more depth in the first movie. But, I don't know the
details of the novel, so who knows, they might be more faithful than the
first movie. So I guess they just wanted to make an extra buck from an
audience that's too lazy to read subtiles.

While watching this, I kept wondering if would I give it more praise had
I not seen (or known) about the original movie. I'm not sure, because
it comes across as yet-another-horror movie, even though there's a woman
vampire. But that's not exactly a new concept (remember *Interview With
A Vampire*). It's not even remotely interesting. What's most puzzling,
beyond that the shit (it's not that smelly, I just hate it) got made is
the [positive response] it received from critics. WTF!
