This is the most original of all vampire movies I've seen. Nice
performance from the little gal playing the vampire. Also, though it
kills the innocent, you do feel compassion for it. It's origins are
sadly left unexplained. It remained captivating throughout even though
the pacing is slow and the gloss is limited.

[**sidenote**] The re-make had good reviews, so I went into it
excited, only to be [seriously disappointed].
