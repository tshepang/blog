I've been wondering for years which of these two music legends is
superior.

**Miriam Makeba**:

-   3 masterpieces (*Gauteng*; *A Luta Continua*; *Welela*)
-   5 excellent works (*Mam Ndiyalila*; *Meet Me At the River*; *Goodbye
    Poverty*; *Jolinkomo*; *Olili*)

**Letta Mbulu**:

-   1 landmark (*Jikijela*)
-   3 masterpieces (*Not Yet Uhuru*; *Nomathemba*; *Zimkile*)
-   6 excellent works (*Music In the Air*; *Ndi-Phendule*; *Buza*; *I
    Need Your Love*; *Maru a pula*; *Kube*)

My [simple rating system] gives Makeba 11 points and Mbuli gets a 15.
That's a scary number since it would mean [she's superior to Salif
Keita]! This I should revisit.

[**sidenote**] Oh, and I'm sure there's a lot of Miriam's work that
I haven't trawled through. Either that or Miriam Makeba is, though
excellent, is overrated, since I suspect she becomes a common answer to
the question "who's the greatest female South African musician?".
That's the answer that I also once had until I savoured much of Letta
Mbulu's work and walked away amazed.
