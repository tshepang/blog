-   [my first CPython feature request]; unsurprisingly, it was rejected
-   I still can't comprehend why Ubuntu gods decided to put their
    window controls on the left, and so does [this guy] ([via])
-   [Operating Systems Lifecycle Chart] -- nice presentation, nice site
    design
-   [The tools] used by one very advanced Debian user; this is quality
    and in-depth writing.
-   Someone claimed [Gnucash was to blame] for her move to Linux-based
    systems; for another, [the tool was Meld].
