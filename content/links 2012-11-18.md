-   [Challenges for Linux networking]; sad to read of these shortcomings
-   refusal to accept a reasonable, popular, and easy-to-implement
    request, [an option to never turn off the screen]
-   [great praise for Qt and its docs]; me was led to it when
    researching a cross-platform (Linux and Windows) GUI toolkit

    the great appeal of [Git Magic]
