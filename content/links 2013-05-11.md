-   [Python interpreter finally gets tab completion by default]; to see
    wide use, this will have to wait for 3.4 release, [which will only
    arrive early 2014].
-   I submitted [my first bug report for Emacs], perhaps my first ever
    to a pure GNU project; I say this because GNOME claims to be one,
    but it\'s really only by name.
-   [Excellent guide on improving Python performance]; it\'s written
    with PyPy in mind, but has excellent generic advice.
-   I enjoyed [this podcast] where Jeff Atwood talks about his new
    project, [Discourse].
