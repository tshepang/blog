-   [This guy presents] 2 incredible ideas; one has been running for
    years (humans translating text that's hard to read by machines,
    while authenticating themselves as humans - [reCAPTCHA]), and
    another that is brand new, known as [Duolingo].
-   [Sbhonyonyo the ugly mermaid] - this is habsolutely (sic) hilarious!
-   [Connoisseur] - poking fun at the definition of the word
-   [Bored With the Internet] - very relevant cartoon, except it applies
    to my love for movies, whereby, while watching, am already thinking
    what I will write in my review; sometimes I think I am a loser
