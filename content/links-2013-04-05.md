-   I don't care much for C#, but [this 'negative' book review] by
    [a luminary] in the .NET community is worthy.
-   [a video] on the awesome Disqus commenting system
-   [LibreOffice progress] is quite impressive.
-   [pros of text over video]
-   [going from simple to complex in teaching/learning programming]
