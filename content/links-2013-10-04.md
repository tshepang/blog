-   [a nicely summarised survey of fresh Debian contributors]
-   [excellent response to an unpleasant reply] - [I admire Michael
    Biebl], but don't remember him be this harsh
-   I enjoyed watching [Skyfield and 15 Years of Bad APIs], a far more
    interesting talk than the earlier [API Design for Library Authors].
    The former covers API design only in its 2nd half, and the latter is
    exclusively all API talk. The former is also more polished than the
    latter, both in terms of video editing, and how presentable the
    presentation is.
-   [great kudos for (the great) Guido van Rossum]
-   [Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names] - interesting
