I had one of the most exciting moments in my life when I got offered a
job at a [software development company] (the title is Analyst: Software
Engineering). I don\'t even know what my planned-for tasks are, and I
was all the more surprised because I think I didn\'t do well at the
interview. Great news is I didn\'t expect a coding job so soon,
especially given I don\'t have previous professional exposure.

I am an electronic technician (lesser than an engineer) by trade and am
pretty unhappy in my current job (testing, calibration, and
fault-finding of gyro-stabilised airborne surveillance/observation
systems). That\'s partly because I don\'t really get challenged since
I\'m on a production line. I do strongly doubt I\'d be job-hunting was I
in development/engineering.

Best of all however is I\'ll be working on software, a dream job really,
considering I love computers and all, and specifically the software part
of it. Electronics is fine too, but the last time I really got close to
it was back in school, and I\'m here talking of design, not \"testing,
calibration\...\".

How lucky can one get!
