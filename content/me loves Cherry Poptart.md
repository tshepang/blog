This morning I read \"Cherry Does the Time Warp\", part of the funny and
politically satirical adult comic series, [Cherry]. It\'s not the first
time I\'ve read a Cherry installment, but this specific one parodies
some characters in history and popular media in a fun manner, but it\'s
highlight is Cherry\'s encounter with her teenage, sexually-inept mom
(and you can imagine what transpires).
