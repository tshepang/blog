I really like the [new website design] of the Git project ([story]). It
even gained a nice and fresh icon, replacing the old which looked like
it was created in 1995. Note that [the old site] wasn't crap either,
and was already pretty much modern, following the 'simple and bold'
design trend I've witnessed in recent years. I'm jealous it's better
than that of [Mercurial], my favorite VCS.
