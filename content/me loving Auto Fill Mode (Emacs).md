For the past 2 weeks or so, I have been learning Emacs, something I've
been meaning to do for years now. I decided to do it seriously (not skip
a day, sometimes hours at a time), and am really liking it. It's a very
well-designed application with a great amount of polish, far more than
any editor I've seen yet (I've used Vim, Geany, Scribes, and Eclipse).
It also helps that the documentation is so [well-written].

So far, my single most favorite feature is [Auto Fill Mode], which
allows you to keep typing without caring about line breaks, for they get
automatically get applied for you. Am very sure that this feature exists
elsewhere, but I actually never used it.

Related to that is the [fill-paragraph] command, which is invoked via
the Alt+q shortcut (M-q) in Emacs speak. What it does is reformat the
paragraph as if it was typed while in Auto Fill Mode. Is gorgeous!
