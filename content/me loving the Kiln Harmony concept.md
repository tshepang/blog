I tend to work a lot with both Git and Mercurial, and to ease the pain
of forgetting which I\'m using at a given moment, I created a setup I
described on [another post]. An even better solution is having all this
sorted out on the server side, so that it doesn\'t matter which of the
two I\'m using. This comes in a form of a product named [Kiln Harmony],
which also turns out to be [a complex beast] behind-the-scenes. Would be
kool to see a FLOSS implementation of this.
