A very solid story with superb, but disturbing, direction. The concept
is among the best I have seen. The acting is top class, notably the
three leads: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano (in a role
that seems written especially for him). The twist sucks a bit
unfortunately, especially given that the lead appears to be a reasonable
character.
