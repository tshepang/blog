title: '\''Common Sense Atheism\'' rocks!'
---

I\'ve read dozens of posts by [Luke Muehlhauser] at his [Common Sense
Atheism] site, among the best blogs I\'ve read ever, which also happens
to be the first and only atheism blog I regularly read. The guy
regularly manages to enthrall me with his thorough and very broad
outlook on the topic, managing to put words where I\'d fail (or even
sub-topics I wouldn\'t expect anyone would write about), his
intelligence (EG when debating some real smart theists), the courage of
promoting some [off-beat ideas], not to mention the quality of much of
the commentary he receives from readers. What makes these even more
impressive is that the guy is in the 1st half of his twenties.

\[**sidenote**\] My favorite posts are too many, so here\'s his own
links to [what he deems most useful]. He has also received serious
praise from his other readers (check the comments [here])
