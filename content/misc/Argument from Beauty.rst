Argument from Beauty
====================

So there's a bunch of `arguments for the existence of God`_, and
learning about them is actually fun for me. I find the `Argument from
beauty`_, though not the strongest of all, the most seductive. It's ever
so nice when I joke about it, like when I see a super-hot gal (the sort
you'd be glad to eat her shit just to have a taste of her pussy) or
enjoying a wonderful meal (like the one I enjoyed last weekend when
visiting Botswana). I'd throw something like, "How could such a gal have
evolved to this form through blind forces of nature! God-did-it!".
