..

    My brain did not evolve to have accurate intuitions about what is
    morally right or wrong or rational. My brain evolved to eat and
    fuck. So I have no reason to trust my intuitions about "right" or
    "wrong" or "rational."

Another gem by the fabulous__ Luke Muehlhauser.
The post is a fun read; check it out.
