Nanotech and Open Source
========================

I was fascinated to find that Christine Peterson of Nanotech fame
`coined`_ the term Open Source (more or less, a business-friendly name
for Free/Libre software, leading to a common compromise of calling the
entire thing FLOSS for Free/Libre/Open Source Software). I remember Eric
Drexler, possibly the greatest force in that most anticipated of
technologies, mentioning something about FLOSS but I didn't know that he
was so closely-invoved as to personally interact with Bruce Perens, one
of the key FLOSS representatives.
