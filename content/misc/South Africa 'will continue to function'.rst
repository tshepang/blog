South Africa 'will continue to function'
========================================

...

   Despite Zuma, the country will continue to function - because the ANC
   does not do everything wrong, because South Africa has a strong,
   self-confident, heterogenous civil society as well as a sovereign,
   independent legal system, a vocal media landscape, and a solid,
   diversified economy.

This slightly reduces my fears of great social instability since it
does not look like the next 5 years will be better than the last 5. It
could even be worse, given we are said to be among `the most unequal
countries in terms of individual wealth`__. There is no predicting the
future, but it does not look to me there is much hope, short of some
miracles. That the landscape of political power is practically left
unchanged is worrying.
