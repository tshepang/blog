**update**: after an unbearably-long downtime, I decided to make the
switch, this time to **Posterous** (now-defunct).

As much as I love Tumblr, I got a few complaints:

-   performance for some tasks is really bad; the most annoying one is
    the time it takes for the Edit button to appear
-   search is real bad; often it doesn\'t find stuff I know is there;
    sometimes I have to re-run the search before seeing results
-   **Pages**: I can\'t use Markdown to edit them
-   **Pages**: I\'m not presented with the Edit button at all; I instead
    have to do it via the Dashboard, then click Customize, then click
    Pages, then scroll and find the page I wanna edit!
-   [horrible uptime]

I\'m not sure if these problems will be fixed (I\'ve reported one bug,
without any real feedback). The collective of these problems makes me
wanna search for another blog host. The challenge with the move is doing
the laborious internal re-linking over again.
