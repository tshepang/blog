title: Valve appears anarchistic
---

While reading [how this legendary game creator is run] (or at least used
to be), I was pretty much reminded that\'s kinda how an anarchistic
business would be run. I was pleasantly surprised to later encounter a
section named *The Workers Control the Means of Production* on the same
article. Kool stuff. \[[via]\]
