Vox Day's 'omniderigence'
=========================

I really enjoyed reading the section titled Omniderigence in `Vox
Day`_'s book, 'The Irrational Atheist'. The term, which he coined,
means the use of one's infinite powers which by the way he disagrees
with. As far as I've read, his appears the most sensical description
of God I've heard and is a radical departure from what your (stereo)typical
Christian would state.

**sidenotes**

-  This guy is a real good writer and I enjoyed his analogy of his
   religious believes and game-design, in another section named 'Gods of
   the Machine'.
-  He explains the term `elsewhere`_ too.
-  Check out his `debate`_ with atheist blogger, `Luke Muehlhauser`_.
   That's the debate that led me to the Vox's book.
