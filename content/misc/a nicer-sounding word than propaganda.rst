a nicer-sounding word than 'propaganda'

    ...O'Reilly meme-engineers a nice euphemism -- "meme-engineering" -- to
    describe what has previously been known as "propaganda."

This is a reaction to Tim O'Reilly's definition of that nicer-sounding term,
which goes thus:

    Just as gene engineering allows us to artificially shape genes,
    meme-engineering lets us organize and shape ideas so that they
    can be transmitted more effectively,
    and have the desired effect once they are transmitted.

All this could be out-of-context, but I didn't care to check for myself.
