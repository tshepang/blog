So `I really loved the 1st episode`_ of this series, and `the 2nd`_, not
so much. Fortunately the allure came back with `the 3rd in the series`_,
with its wonderful humor. It basically is a retelling of a tale Alonzo,
the foremost proponent of the theory, of an earlier post named `A
Harmony of Desires`_.
