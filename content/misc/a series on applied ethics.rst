a series on applied ethics
==========================

There's this hot new ethical theory named Desirism which sounds both
elegant and simple:

-  **description**: desires are the only motivators for intentional
   action & we act so as to fulfill our strongest desires, given our
   believes
-  **prescription**: encourage desires that tend to fulfill other
   desires & discourage desires that tend to thwart other desires

It's two greatest proponents have started `a series on it`_, and I'm all
so excited, and the first episode rocks hard!
