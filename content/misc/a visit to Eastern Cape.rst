a visit to Eastern Cape
=======================

:date: 2007-05-07



I enjoyed the beautiful countryside of Nyosini, a small (a few hundred
households?) rural village nearby a buzzing Mount Frere, a town set atop
a hill of the same name. This `Eastern Cape`__ village is the home of a
friend of mine and the visit happened to be an excuse to see the
province for the first time in my life, and the highlight was the
amazing hospitality granted by the home we stayed during most of the
visit, and the closeness of family I experienced here is unmatched in
memory. Notable and positive mention ought be granted to 3 characters
(Lwazi, Bongo, Siya) for reasons I'm too lazy to mention.
