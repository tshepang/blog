a visit to Mozambique
=====================

Outside my country, South Africa, I have only been to Botswana,
Swaziland, and Lesotho. I recently visited Mozambique, and it feels
far more different compared. The most notable thing is that Portuguese
dominates far more than English. It was quite hard to find people we
(me and `a friend`__) could ask for help as we navigated its largest
city, Maputo. Other issues:

- There are too many people seeking to take advantage of foreigners,
  like overpricing much of their shit, and gradually lowering them
  when faced with protest. I suppose this shitty practice is found
  everywhere, but it's particularly rife there. At the border post,
  for example, you'd have 3-4 guys trying to score something by
  offering the service of guiding us through the border (fill this
  form, queue here for this, etc.), and would ask for something like
  R100 for that... ridiculous! Perhaps I should not complain given the
  great poverty the country suffers... only desperate people would
  behave like that I'm guessing.

- The condition of Maputo, the city we stayed at, is horrific. It
  looks like a very run-down Durban, and quite large as well. We
  didn't explore it as much as would have liked, but it's such pain,
  given the language barriers, as well as hardly having any street
  names or markings on buildings. We were in bad need for a
  guide. Most on the buildings are in a very dilapidated state. A very
  rough guess over 80% of them, though you'd find something
  gorgeous here and there. The roads are heavily congested and the
  drivers very inconsiderate... the worst I've seen. It's amazing
  there wasn't a traffic accident we've witnessed. Anyways, it was
  mostly not a pleasant city, and so many of the streets were damn
  dirty. It's fucked-up.

- The prices of stuff was ridiculous. One particularly egregious
  example is the price of eggs as we saw in a franchise that also
  operates in South Africa. A pack of 60 went for M360 (about R120)!
  That's about twice the price in South Africa. Accommodation was
  expensive too; the place we got cost about M2200 and that was the
  cheaper one we could get, but was yet disappointing:

  + We were provided only a single pillow for each of us (separate
    beds in one room), and it didn't look pleasant for the attendant
    to get us another.

  + There was just one parking space. That I just don't understand.

  + The bed I was on was uncomfortable. I was discouraged from
    complaining because it just felt like I was bothering the hosts,
    and I had already complained about the not-cold water provided in
    the room. I don't like feeling like a bother.

  + The hot water was rather luke-warm, though it wasn't too much of
    an issue given the high temperatures of the city. In addition, the
    pressure of the water was quite low.

  + I didn't like it when one the senior workers asked us not to drink
    alcohol (in case we were planning to) because he was Muslim, and
    that it was a Muslim-owned place. Such arrogance!

This sort of thing really lessened the enjoyment of the trip there. I
felt unwelcome really, and it made me miss my far-more-pleasant South
Africa. I am sure there is far less crime there, but South Africa is
not particularly scary either (in general). It also has far better and
much cheaper places to sleep. We could very well have missed some
great lodging places in Mozambique, that Maputo is just a shit place
to be, and we should have avoided it, who knows. We didn't do much
research on it really, and decided to take a chance. It didn't work
out, but I'm glad we tried. I would like to go some other time (I hear
there's great beaches), but with proper guides, perhaps via a cruise
ship.

In the end, we just decided to cut our trip short, and went back to
South Africa.
