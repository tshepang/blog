I just a read a very interesting post on how to gain market share, but
what prompted me to blog it is the following snippet which states the
advantages of being friendly towards customers:

    ...It reminds me of independent booksellers, who said "why should I
    make it comfortable for people to read books in my store? I want
    them to buy the books!" And then one day Barnes and Nobles puts
    *couches* and *cafes* in the stores and practically *begged* people
    to read books in their store without buying them. Now you've got all
    these customers sitting in their stores for *hours* at a time,
    mittengrabben all the books with their filthy hands, and the
    probability that they find something they want to buy is linearly
    proportional to the amount of time they spend in the store, and even
    the dinkiest Barnes and Nobles superstore in Iowa City rakes in
    hundreds of dollars a *minute* while the independent booksellers are
    going out of business. Honey, Shakespeare and Company on Manhattan's
    Upper West Side did *not* close because Barnes and Nobles had
    cheaper prices, it closed because Barnes and Nobles had *more human
    beings in the building*.

Why I like it is that I used to frequent some local book/magazine
franchise whose merchandise I liked but just couldn't afford. That made
the experience uncomfortable, the risk of being told to leave.
