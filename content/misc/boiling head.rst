============

..

  I mean, if he'd replied to that hideous and obviously impractical
  macro with "Go boil your head", despite being something you could
  interpret as a command to greviously injure myself, I'd have gotten
  a chuckle out of it and assumed he was being facetious. If anything,
  I'd be more upset that he hadn't taken the opportunity to tell me to
  throw some vegetables in with my head when I boiled it to at least
  make a semi-decent "pork" broth.
