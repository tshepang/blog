debate: Mike Licona vs Richard Carrier
======================================

I recently listened to a 2.5 hour-long `debate`_ between two scholars,
`Richard Carrier`_ and `Mike Licona`_, which alerted me to the fact that
Jesus' Resurrection is regarded, at least to Christian apologists, to be
very central to the Christian faith (here's `an unsatisfactory
review`_). I became far more impressed with Richard's performance than
Mike's:

-  Mike was the only one who displayed some arrogance (a silly joke here
   and a chuckle there, unsuccessfully forcing his opponent to use the
   word delusion instead of hallucination, etc.).
-  Richard was more convincing (and the knowledge he displayed of this
   topic is mind-numbing).
-  He was more clear with his arguments.
-  He was seemingly more prepared (his opponent probably thought he was
   going to be a walkover).
-  Mike was a bit embarassing at times when mentioning The Passion of
   Christ, especially the time when he was praising Jesus (I cringed a
   bit there), and Richard, by the way, ignored references to that
   movie.

Based on these points, I vote for Richard as the winner, with the
disclaimer that the latter part of the debate was getting too technical
for me to follow thoroughly.

**sidenotes**:

-  See `Luke Muehlhauser`_'s `well-argued take`_ on the issue of the
   Resurrection.
-  Luke's blog, `Common Sense Atheism`_ (`praise`_), apparently has `the
   largest collection of links to atheist vs theist debates`_ and is
   therefore a great resource.
