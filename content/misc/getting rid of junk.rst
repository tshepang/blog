PZ Myers of [Pharyngula] fame is the best atheist writer I\'ve read yet,
and his blog challenges that of Luke Muehlhauser\'s [Common Sense
Atheism] as the best atheism blog I\'ve read yet. Watch him [trash away]
his Bible and Koran, in a far more symbolic way than I did with my Bible
some years ago\... I simply piled it on top of the rest of the trash.
