PZ Myers of Pharyngula__ fame is the best atheist writer I've read yet,
and his blog challenges that of Luke Muehlhauser's `Common Sense Atheism`__
as the best atheism blog I've read yet.
Watch him `trash away`__ his Bible and Koran,
in a far more symbolic way than I did with my Bible some years ago...
I simply piled it on top of the rest of the trash.
