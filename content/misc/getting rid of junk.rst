PZ Myers of `Pharyngula`_ fame is the best atheist writer I've read yet,
and his blog challenges that of `Luke Muehlhauser`_'s `Common Sense
Atheism`_, as the best atheism blog I've read yet.
Watch him `trash away`_ his Bible and Koran,
in a far more symbolic way than I did with
my Bible some years ago... I simply put it in the trash.
