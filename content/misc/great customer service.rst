title: great customer service
---

So these guys at [BMW Bavarian East Pretoria] (it has since been
closed), a motorbike dealership, got me impressed with their great
customer service. The standard procedure is to lend customers a bike for
a few hours to use during the day, which normally happens when one takes
the bike in for service. My [F650CS] was giving me some trouble which
actually perplexed them for more than those few hours\... a few weeks
actually.

So why I says they rock:

-   I wasn\'t charged for the extra (perhaps dozens) hours of labour.
-   I was lent a bike (actually 3, since the troubleshooting went for so
    long that they needed to sell 2 of those bikes in the meanwhile).
-   Not sure if I should call this negligence, but there seems to be
    some deep trust these guys have for their customers, because no one
    cared to check if I could ride the variety of bikes they lent me.
    That\'s gorgeous, especially considering that one of the bikes they
    lent me was the superhot [BMW F800S].

Of course there is also the element of them encouraging loyalty, but
this still goes beyond the normal \"customer is king\" routine.
