-   [What You\'ll Wish You\'d Known] is one the best essays I\'ve read
    yet; it basically is advice for people still in high school. Beware
    though that the writer, Paul Graham, is very bold person. He makes a
    lot of assertions, without much in the way of backing it all up.
    Sure he\'s well-read and experienced, but it appears he relies a lot
    on his intuitions. Inaccurate as it may be, this essay has a lot of
    insight and is very encouraging (e.g. don\'t underestimate your
    abilities).

-   [On Parenthood] - incredible write-up on the joys of having a
    child\... this isn\'t material I normally read, but I felt compelled
    considering my admiration for the writer, a famous software
    developer; it almost makes me look forward to my first
