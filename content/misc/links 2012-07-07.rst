-  `some women get their pussies mutilated for some shitty reasons!`_

-  `Luke Muehlhauser on feminism`_ - superb writing

-  `the futility of theist vs. atheist debate`_

-  I really enjoyed the humor in the humorous `Threw It On the Ground`_
   music video; even the music is nice

-  me not sure I would qualify for a job at Netflix, due its `highly
   demanding culture`_ would be extra kool if more large companies
   adopted something similar
