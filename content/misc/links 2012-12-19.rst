-  `This guy presents`_ 2 incredible ideas; one has been running for
   years (humans translating text that's hard to read by machines, while
   authenticating themselves as humans - `reCAPTCHA`_), and another that
   is brand new, known as `Duolingo`_.

-  `Sbhonyonyo the ugly mermaid`_ - this is habsolutely (sic) hilarious!

-  `on the supremacy of Japanese toilets`_; whoever said toilet humor
   can't be smart and hilarious at the same time

-  `Connoisseur`_ - poking fun at the definition of the word

-  `Bored With the Internet`_ - very relevant cartoon, except it applies
   to my love for movies, whereby, while watching, am already thinking
   what I will write in my review; sometimes I think I am a loser
