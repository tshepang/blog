-   [a nice post] on why static blog generation rocks; much better (and
    more detailed) than [mine]
-   [the fallacy of fast growth]
-   [being hardcore]; nice humor
-   [embracing an ever-changing language]
-   loving the clean design of [this page]; most of all, I love the
    code/pre tag rendering.
