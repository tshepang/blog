* `a nice post`__ on why static blog generation rocks;
  much better (and more detailed) than mine__

* `the fallacy of fast growth`__

* `being hardcore`__; nice humor

* `embracing an ever-changing language`__

* loving the clean design of `this page`__;
  most of all, I love the code/pre tag rendering.
