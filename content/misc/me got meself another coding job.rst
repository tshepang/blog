================================

Some years ago, I was totally excited by having `my first job working on
software`_. I am very grateful for the chance the owner, who interviewed
me for the position, took on me. I learned an incredible amount of
stuff.

Some months ago, a friend enticed me to the idea of doing something
else, giving me contacts for `some company`_ building software and
electronics products for the mining industry. So I wasn't actually
looking for work, but I was glad of the opportunity since I was sort of
stagnating, and it really looked like this new company did some more fun
stuff, and I got the vibe that I'd really get challenged.

It's been 3 months now, and my guess was right. I keep getting surprised
by the levels of smart I encounter regurlarly. These are the sorts of
people I simply can't match with my lesser brain, but am glad to work
with, since they teach me so much.

The systems we build are embedded, so I spend most of my time working
with C and C++, and it tends to be a serious challenge, given that
there's a lot less hand-holding with those than with my favorite,
Python.
