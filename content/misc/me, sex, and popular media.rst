me, sex, and popular media
==========================

:date: 2012-05-12



So, what's my position regarding sex? I dream of a world where sex was
less taboo. A world where a gal will not hesitate to fuck me if she was
attracted to me. A world without inhibitions. A world where I could walk
naked in front of my mom, and even fuck her if we both wanted to, and
we'd do it in front of dad if he didn't mind, and maybe he'd even join
us. I just wish the world wasn't so uptight. It's so frustrating when
some gal wouldn't mind fucking me, but there's these limitations of "but
I don't wanna feel cheap", or "what will people say?".

So, am I a sucker for sex? Well, maybe. But what I do is fantasize a lot
and there's movies that explore (and promotes) these fantasies so well.
What comes to mind now is `Vicky Cristina Barcelona`_ (on first
viewing), and to a lesser extent, `Spread`_, both of which I saw first
time in 2010. Much earlier, something that rocked my world perhaps as
much was `Threesome`_, which I saw maybe in the late 90's. There's also
a comic that ravishes my sexual fantasies which is `Cherry`_.

*Vicky Christina Barcelona* has a guy, his ex-wife, and his fuck buddy
tumbling into a threesome. *Spread* sees a lady allowing his man to fuck
other gals without going into a tantrum (she's my hero, but she was also
real, since she was still jealous). *Threesome* has 2 guys sharing a
pussy, and most interesting, the guys discover that they don't mind
invading each other either. *Cherry*, more a fantasy than the other
works, is pure paradise. It's gorgeous. The title character and mom, for
example, don't mind fucking. No one hesitates offering sex, and
especially Cherry herself.
