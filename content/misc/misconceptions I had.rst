misconceptions I had
====================

:date: 2012-12-26



From `one of the most important articles on Wikipedia`_:

-  the most surprising one is that microwaves do not work by emitting
   waves at resonance frequency of water; they work using `some other
   method`_

-  the Great Wall of China is not visible from space (unaided)

-  seasons are not caused by the Earth being closer to the Sun in the
   summer than in the winter

-  we are not born with all brain cells we will ever have; this is a
   recent discovery (2000s)

-  Frankenstein was actually the name of the creator of the monster, not
   the monster itself

-  Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb
