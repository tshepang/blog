my deconversion

One of the top atheism bloggers today, `Luke Muehlhauser`__, posted a
`gorgeous snippet`__ by a Christian who happens to be unhappy with the
contents of the Bible, a story which is scarily similar to mine.

Often people ask me when I became atheist, and I can't answer them
with a date since it was more of a process, and reading the Bible (the
entire thing) was among the earliest steps towards that end... the God
I imagined couldn't have allowed things as horrendous__ as portrayed
in the Old Testament. I kept praying, asking God to help me keep my
faith, but no one answered :(
