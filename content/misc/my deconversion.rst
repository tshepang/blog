One of the top atheism bloggers today, `Luke Muehlhauser`_, posted a
`gorgeous snippet`_ by a Christian who happens to be unhappy with the
contents of the Bible, a story which is scarily similar to mine.

Often people ask when I became atheist, and I can't answer them with a
date since it was more of a process, and reading the Bible (the entire
thing) was among the earliest steps towards that end â€” the God I
imagined couldn't allow things as `horrendous`_ as portrayed in the Old
Testament. I proceeded to praying hard since I saw I was losing faith, a
scary thing when you are so indoctrinated, and then noticed that I was
trying to convince self of non-existent junk.
