Blogger\'s post editor is so bad that I\'ve been promising myself to
move elsewhere for quite a while. I checked on [Super User] what their
recommendations are and they pointed mostly to Wordpress (which I found
too ugly) but someone there also pointed to [Tumblr], which I never
heard of before. It really is more than a blogging platform (which was
all I was actually looking for), and it does look good except for the
fact that I miss the sidebar functionality which allows me to place
things like favorite blogs, favorite posts, etc.
