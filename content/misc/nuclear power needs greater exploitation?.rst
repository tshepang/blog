nuclear power needs greater exploitation?

It's not the first time I've seen something similar, but here's someone else
who believes that `harnessing the power of the atom`_ is the way to go
to avert the global energy crisis. I especially like this quote:

    So hybrid cars are just one piece of the bigger solution because the
    problem is huge. Spewing billions of tons of carbon, plus 20,000
    tons of thorium and uranium, plus thousands of tons of mercury and
    arsenic into the air and our lungs is just stupid. It is especially
    wrong for people to fear nuclear power whose worst accident was
    Chernobyl with 50 dead and 4000 made very ill when coal kills more
    than that in about an hour.
