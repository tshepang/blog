    So hybrid cars are just one piece of the bigger solution because the
    problem is huge. Spewing billions of tons of carbon, plus 20,000
    tons of thorium and uranium, plus thousands of tons of mercury and
    arsenic into the air and our lungs is just stupid. It is especially
    wrong for people to fear nuclear power whose worst accident was
    Chernobyl with 50 dead and 4000 made very ill when coal kills more
    than that in about an hour.

Another person who believes that harnessing the power of the atom
is the way to go to help avert the global energy crisis.
I am compelled to agree, though the issue is a complex one.
