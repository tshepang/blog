on taste and morality
=====================

..

    I have an aversion to eating liver. I do not like the smell, or the
    taste, of eating liver. However, in spite of my personal aversion,
    it would be wrong for me to use this to justify prohibiting others
    from eating liver. Because I do not like it, I do not eat it. I
    could say that I do not like to eat liver because it is
    intrinsically bad, and because it is intrinsically bad anybody who
    likes the taste of liver must be defective. I could try to make that
    argument, but there would be no merit to it. I would be wrong. In my
    error, I would be interfering with the liberty of others for no good
    reason.
