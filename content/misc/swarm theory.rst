swarm theory
============

:date: 2007-07-09



It's interesting that `the article`_ that documents swarm behaviour
confirms the philosophy that I've held for a few years now that states
that "human society is too complex to comprehend". It's also interesting
that the article's conclusion is pretty compatible with a [society
imagined by anarchists][].
