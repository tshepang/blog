tainted Teresa

While I was thinking of the topic I covered in `noble dreams`_,
Mother Teresa appeared in my mind due the imagery of nobility that she
possesses. I decided to go check out `her story`_ for inspiration,
and came back disappointed and even shocked at much of her (alleged)
shortcomings.

Nevertheless, I was captivated by her words:

    [our mission is to take care of] the hungry, the naked, the
    homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who
    feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that
    have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone.
