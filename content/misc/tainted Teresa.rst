While I was thinking of the topic I covered in [noble dreams], Mother
Teresa appeared in my mind due the imagery of nobility that she
possesses. I decided to go check out [her story] for inspiration, and
came back disappointed and even shocked at much of her (alleged)
shortcomings.

Nevertheless, I was captivated by her words:

> \[our mission is to take care of\] the hungry, the naked, the
> homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who
> feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that
> have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone.
