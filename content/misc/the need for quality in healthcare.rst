    For every drowned and pulseless child rescued by intensive care,
    there are many more who don't make it—and not just because their
    bodies are too far gone. Machines break down; a team can't get
    moving fast enough; a simple step is forgotten. Such cases don't get
    written up in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery, but they are the norm.
    Intensive-care medicine has become the art of managing extreme
    complexity—and a test of whether such complexity can, in fact, be
    humanly mastered.

That's some scary shit. Read `the whole article`_ to get the context
(i.e. the heroic work involved in saving that girl's life). It's a great
read.
