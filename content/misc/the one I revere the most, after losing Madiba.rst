the one I revere most, after losing Madiba
==========================================

For a long time, there was not a single living individual I respected
more than I did Madiba. That would explain the fact of my weeping on
the morning I heard of his death, which is something I never did for
any single individual. For some time now, I actually asked myself
which of his many deeds lead to such reverence, and I don't really
know. I do strongly suspect though that it's the key role he played in
ending government-sanctioned racism against non-Caucasians in South
Africa. Being a Black citizen of that country, this is something that
affected me personally, and something I will eternally be grateful
for. In addition to that, this man is also not just as hero (being a
freedom fighter), but also a saint (promoting reconciliation with the
oppressors). It's not only that, but also the fact that the man is
constantly hailed as an icon of peace.

For a number of times, I would ask myself if there was anyone alive
who garners greater respect, and the only person who came close is
`the current Dalai Lama`__, but I must admit I don't know much about him,
beyond his winning a Nobel Peace Prize. Another candidate is
`Desmond Tutu`__, who frequently speaks against injustice, and also
happens to be a winner of that most prestigious of awards.

There is one other candidate, `Noam Chomsky`__. I deeply respect his
intellect and activism... watching and listening to some of his
political work some time in 2012 led me to consider him the most
valuable person alive. His influence is likely smaller than that of the
above-mentioned candidates, but being the world's foremost
Anarchist is quite something, especially given that it's the most
attractive of all political theories I've yet encountered.

So, with a disclaimer that I am largely ignorant of world events, Noam
Chomsky takes the place of Nelson Mandela as **the living individual I
admire the most**.
