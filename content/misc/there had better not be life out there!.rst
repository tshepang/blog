there had better not be life out there!

I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading `an essay`_ on why we better hope we
don't discover extra-terrestrial life. It's 8 pages of superb writing
and is pretty thorough (check how he explains the myriad possibilities,
and how he challenges even those), and nearly as exciting as the 1st
time I read Richard Feynman's "`There's Plenty of Room At the
Bottom`_". I consider this essential reading for any enquiring mind.
