trying out Calepin
==================

**update**: The lack of reliability, worst of which was constant
unavailability of my blog lead me to move on, this time to `Pelican`_,
and hosted by `GitHub Pages`_. `Here's the setup`_.

--------------

I've been meaning to move my blog(s) away from Posterous, due to its UI
problems and ridiculously-slow page loads. I finally did it with the
help of `Calepin`_, which itself has a bunch of problems, which is
forgiveable given that it's a Beta product:

-  The presentation is way too simple/plain, and doesn't provide a way
   to customise it.
-  I spent hours struggling with Dropbox login integration, where I
   often had to go to Chrome's Incognito mode, and at some point, had to
   delete my Dropbox account as well, just to get it to work.
-  It seems crazy that each time I want to publish I have to visit the
   web page to hit Publish, when Calepin should simply monitor the
   Dropbox account.
-  The blog is unreachable whenever I publish. This isn't such a big
   deal of course, but c'mon.
-  When hitting Publish, it takes way too long (several seconds) before
   the page is rendered on the blog.
-  ...and am sure there will be more as time goes (proven by the fact
   that this list kept growing as I typed this post)

Despite all these problems, it will have to do for now, until I find
another host, and maybe this time I will have to spend some cash.

In the interest of balance, here's `what attracted me`.
