what me loves about static website generation
=============================================

There's a ridiculous amount of power and flexiblity in having all the
blog sources locally:

- The blog is maintained as a set of files which I can edit with any
  text editor, which skips the trouble of having to go to some
  web-based text editor.
- What this implies is that I can now put the blog in `version control`_.
- This also means that I can do a heck of a lot of edits without being
  connected to the web, or deeper changes searching and replacing
  throughout the entire blog.
- This also means I need not worry about losing my data.
- Lastly, one can use text editor of choice, which is a big help,
  given the quality of web-based editors in general.

* The complexity of `the setup` is going to scare many people away.
* It can take a lot of time to setup;
  I spent too many hours here, partly also because I have a lot of posts
  and `am rather particular`_ about the look and functionality of the result.
