From [one of the most important articles on Wikipedia]:

-   the most surprising one is that microwaves do not work by emitting
    waves at resonance frequency of water; they work using [some other
    method]
-   the Great Wall of China is not visible from space (unaided)
-   seasons are not caused by the Earth being closer to the Sun in the
    summer than in the winter
-   we are not born with all brain cells we will ever have; this is a
    recent discovery (2000s)
-   Frankenstein was actually the name of the creator of the monster,
    not the monster itself
-   Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb
