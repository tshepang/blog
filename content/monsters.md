Following is a review I made in 2014:

> Although directing/editing style is not new, it still feels
fresh. The visual effects are also done well, but the aftermath of the
damage done by both the title characters and the military is done even
better. One thing that's impressive about the whole production is that
it's very expansive for a budget of less than $1 million. You would
not even notice. Sadly, there is a point where the lead characters are
tiring, such that I'd appreciate if at least one of them got killed at
some point. They are also too damn lucky.

I didn't find the characters tiring this time around,
nor did I care about their luck.
I also enjoyed all performances,
and as mentioned in the older review,
the aftermath of the damage is amazing,
among the best ever,
much of it set in gorgeous scenery.
