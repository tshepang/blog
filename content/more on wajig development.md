I was [given commit access] to wajig project, and did a heck of a lot of
clean-ups, and in the process, learning much about unit testing. I aimed
for a comprehensive solution, partly to avoid regressions, since I
intend to do lot of code changes.

I also looked at converting wajig\'s GUI [from Glade to GtkBuilder].
