*This is in the sense of largest number of end users*

- [millions use TiKV](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2019/05/21/toc-votes-to-move-tikv-into-cncf-incubator)
  ([adopters](https://tikv.org/adopters)), a distributed transactional key-value database.
  One of those adopters [has over 200m users](https://pingcap.com/success-stories/tidb-in-mobike) (mid 2018).
  This is, for me, the most impressive Rust success story.

- [500m people use Dropbox](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire)
  (early 2016), whose file storage system is written in Rus.

- [250m people use Firefox](https://data.firefox.com/dashboard/user-activity)
  (late 2019), which has various components written in Rust,
  most notably Stylo, which does CSS style calculation.

- [250m people use Discord](https://blog.discordapp.com/a190bbca2b1f)
  (early 2020), which has Read States service written in Rust,
  whose "sole purpose is to keep track of which channels and messages you have read".
