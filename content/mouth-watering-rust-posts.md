These posts got me excited for this or that Rust creation:

- [Why I'm building a new async runtime][smol] (early 2020)

  Announcement of **smol**, an async runtime.
  Made me want to finally make use of async.

- [warp] (mid 2018)

  Announcement of **warp**, a web framework.
  Made me seriously wanna dabble with Rust web landscape.
  The design looked novel.
  Last I remember being any excited by a web framework was years before,
  with the [Pyramid], back in my Python days.
