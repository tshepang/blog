'300', the visual masterpiece; 'Pulp Fiction', the ex-masterpiece
=================================================================

*300* has unbelievably superb visuals and very attractive characters,
most especially the lead. Ancient warfare has never been portrayed in
such an impressive manner. Another thing of note is I enjoyed myself so
much that I felt the movie, at ~100 minutes, was way too short.

I watched *Pulp Fiction* on Saturday and am sorry that it hasn't aged
well (or it just looks less impressive) which helps remove it from my
all-time Top 3 movies. I found Rosanna Arquette's a superior performance
to all others while Samuel L. Jackson's happened to have more dramatic
impact; the rest of the cast is pretty competent and the script (and
especially the dialogue) remains interesting.
