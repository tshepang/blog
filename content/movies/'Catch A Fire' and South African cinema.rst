'Catch A Fire' and South African cinema
=======================================

:date: 2008-09-18



Less-than-average attempt to capture the life of an Apartheid-era
freedom fighter, none of whose performances deserve any honor and
Williams, the movie's villain, really disgusts, and Bonnie Mbuli (or
whatever the fuck her new surname, and I wonder why the fuck ladies
change surnames when getting married) has done much better before, and
actually to a point where I considered her the cream of young SA talent
(she was easily the best actor in the deservedly now-defunct e.tv
soapie, Backstage).

As in any political movie, I suppose the story/message is supposed to be
more important than the technicalities. I've seen better SA political
stuff like Mapantsula (special because the protagonist didn't give no
shit about 'the struggle' yet emerged a key character) or even the
over-celebrated Sarafina. Off the top of my head, that's all I remember
as far as SA political movies go, a small piece of this most poor of
movie industries. SA makes among the best ever TV advertisements and
even some decent music videos and at least one supreme drama series
(Yizo Yizo) but is yet to really venture into movies, never mind make a
masterpiece. Tsotsi can't count for I don't know how much the bribery
was, cuz, though it ain't shit, it also can't win any award at all,
except maybe for cinematography or so.
