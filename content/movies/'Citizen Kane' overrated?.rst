'Citizen Kane' overrated?
=========================

:date: 2010-07-13



So I checked out *Citizen Kane* again (last time was maybe 8 years ago),
and came back even more surprised why the fuck so many of the world's
top movie critics proclaim it `the greatest movie ever made`_. I must
say though that the director, Orson Welles, ain't that bad of an actor
(but someone should have worked harder at his old-age make-up). Oh, and
I love the in-movie campaign poster, the one that shows the image of the
character he played.

Maybe I must find out what 'greatest' means. Maybe it means influence,
in which case then I wouldn't complain (I suppose the non-linear
storytelling and cinematography were groundbreaking), but if it means
'best', well...
