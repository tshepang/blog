title = "'Cloverfield' vs. 'I Am Legend'"
+++

I was very impressed with Cloverfield which is an experience so far this
year matched only by [I Am Legend]. It got a truly innovative
storytelling approach, and that at a time when my skeptic mind wonders
if Hollywood got something fresh for us. It also possesses superb sound,
and a superb creature/super-Godzilla.

The movie is similar to [I Am Legend] \'cuz:

-   both got conservative use of action visual effects (though more so
    here since we are only given brief views of the fabulous monster)
-   the visual effects of both movies are seemingly flawless
-   both are disaster/horror movies set in New York
-   by the time the end-credits roll, one is left salivating for more

As to which is superior, I\'d vote [I Am Legend] since *Cloverfield* got
some annoyingly unrealistic sequences, which is a pity considering how
the movie is presented. That Cloverfield weakness is however more than
well-compensated by the wonderful acting and direction, all pretty
realistic, and that\'s before the unnamed monster begins its rampage.
