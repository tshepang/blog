'Cloverfield' vs. 'I Am Legend'
===============================

:date: 2008-02-17



I was very impressed with Cloverfield which is an experience so far this
year matched only by `I Am Legend`_. It got a truly innovative
storytelling approach, and that at a time when my skeptic mind wonders
if Hollywood got something fresh for us. It also possesses superb sound,
and a superb creature/super-Godzilla.

The movie is similar to `I Am Legend`_ 'cuz:

-  both got conservative use of action visual effects (though more so
   here since we are only given brief views of the fabulous monster)
-  the visual effects of both movies are seemingly flawless
-  both are disaster/horror movies set in New York
-  by the time the end-credits roll, one is left salivating for more

As to which is superior, I'd vote `I Am Legend`_
since *Cloverfield* got some annoyingly unrealistic sequences, which is
a pity considering how the movie is presented. That Cloverfield weakness
is however more than well-compensated by the wonderful acting and
direction, all pretty realistic, and that's before the unnamed monster
begins its rampage.
