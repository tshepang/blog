'Death Proof' and 'Iron Man'
============================

:date: 2008-10-01



Kurt Russel and Jeff Bridges give very similar (and good) performances
in *Death Proof* and *Iron Man*, respectively. Interestingly I don't
remember any other of their performances that I did enjoy.

In Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino reprises the style he used so well in
`Pulp Fiction`_: lengthy and pointless dialogues that mostly do nothing
to serve the story (and deliberately so I suspect), but nevertheless
interesting, and perhaps the one thing that made people fall in love
with this master-director.

The cast of the first of the 2 stories found in Death Proof is top-rate
and the handling of the material helps the piece feel real fresh. Oh,
and it also got the best (and most gruesome) car crash in recent memory.

A revisit of Iron Man, which I only gave a passive comment back then,
was not too pleasant. The writer's carelessness (or whoever is
responsible for the story) is unaccepatable, and there's much explaining
that's left out, making the movie feel cut too short:

-  the hero takes a while to learn to commandeer his super-suit while
   the villain learns it in minutes
-  the hero manages to build the suit so sophisticated alone and in
   short order (this should not be a complaint given that this is a
   comic book adaptation)
-  the hero manages to fool his captors of what he's building, even
   under camera surveiilance
-  the hero survives way too much physical punishment

You'll wish the filmmakers would invest as much in plausibility and
common sense as in the gorgeous suit on display here... and the
middle-eastern villain is less-than-convincing.
