'Dr. Strangelove' vs. 'Payback'
===============================

:date: 2007-10-23



I have for a long time considered `Dr. Strangelove`_ as the best comedy
ever made, but on watching it yesterday, I actually wonder why it's any
better than my beloved `Payback`_. Other than its pair of detectives,
*Payback* got a great villain (Kris Kristofferson in my most favorite of
his performances) and these are matched by *Dr. Strangelove*'s mad
general (flawless performance by Sterling Hayden) and the gum-chewing
air force general (a rather overdone comic performance by George C.
Scott). *Dr. Strangelove* may have an edge since it's actually a
brilliant satire while *Payback*, well-written as it is, is at the end
just another exciting thriller, lacking dialogue as profound as that
provided by *Dr. Strangelove*'s above-stated characters, and last and
least, the commander of the partly-damaged aircraft carrying nuclear
weapons. The verdict, developed during this post's writing, sees
*Payback* as the lesser of the two.

Sterling Hayden's mad general must have inspired Kris Kristofferson's
crime lord because their mannerisms are so much similar. Although to a
lesser extent, this also applies to George C. Scott's general as
compared to Gregg Henry's Val Resnick, the one who betrayed `Payback`_
lead.
