'Ghost Dog'
===========

:date: 2009-01-09



It has the common basic story of a contract killer forced to target own
clients, but considering that you got Jim Jarmusch at the helm, you bet
*Ghost Dog* won't be your typical ride. It's unlike anything I've seen
before and is totally devoid of Hollywood gloss and seemingly on a
shoe-string budget. It's armed with quite an exotic story (modern-day
Black Samurai who consumes copious amounts of literature and uses
pigeons to communicate with his employers) and got nice comic touches.
The sub-plot involving the kid and the ice-cream man is nice too, and
helps lighten the mood, while serving the main story in other useful
ways. [`newer review`_]
