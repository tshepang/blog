'I Am Legend'
=============

[`newer review`_]

NYC has never looked quite like in *I Am Legend*, with the military
disaster used as an excuse to display among the most impressive sets
ever, complete with broken vehicles, deserted military planes, and
destroyed bridges. Luckily Will Smith carries the lead role so well that
it seems anyone else would have spoiled it, and the storyline is not
predictable, though its suspense tends to be unbearable, the relaxed
direction possibly causing many to catch a nap. And by the way, the
movie also leaves one salivating for more because it's so good,
therefore feeling too short at 100 minutes.
