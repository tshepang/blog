'Knowing'
=========

:date: 2010-08-31



The visual effects of *Knowing* are top-class, and the story is
interesting initially, but the pacing tends to be overly-slow,
especially with the boring daughter of the 'possessed' woman (a bad and
unbearable performance). We also got some boring aliens, and the whole
thing turns out to be seriously idiotic (think *Close Encounters of the
Third Kind*, itself a better movie). It's unbelievable. Nicolas Cage
also shows the limits of his talent, especially near the end. The kids
are boring too. The alien space-ship, an obvious inspiration from *Dark
City* visual look (a movie made by the same director) leaves nothing to
admire, evne though it's entrance is given the grand and wondrous
treament of traditional Hollywood, complete with a loud score and
childlike "wow" of the onlooker. It's a bad movie, but is
gorgeously-shot, and each of the action-pieces, all 4 disaster points
(plane crash, train-smach, truck hit, and armageddon) are all worthy of
repeat viewing, and hence, admiration.

I don't remember a movie that happens to be so okay but crumbles so hard
on revelation of its plot, which in this case happens at the end. What a
mess! Or, there's even paradise, and nobody explains why the hell the
seemingly advanced aliens aren't saving more people. It's so stupid.
Strangely this is a revisit, but I forgot these horrid factors.
