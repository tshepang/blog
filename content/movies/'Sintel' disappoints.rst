'Sintel' disappoints
====================

:date: 2010-11-02



`Sintel`_ is the latest movie project by the Blender Foundation, and
they've been cooking it for over a year now, and the result is really
disappointing, and as with their `previous movie`_, I still feel that
their first movie, *Elephants Dream*, is superior both technically and
artistically.

-  human character animation is really bad, maybe worse than the first
   *Toy Story*; okay they could not afford motion-capture suits, so I
   guess they can be forgiven?
-  the whole thing looks unfinished (EG, much of the environment looks
   too clean, too smooth)
-  character design sux; just look at the old man, and the dragons
-  the lead character is not interesting, nor is she a convincing
   warrior; maybe a juicier ass would have helped, since I suspect the
   movie-makers chose a female character for sex appeal; how else am I
   supposed to swallow a story where a 16-year old gal holds her own
   while battling a few unfriendly characters (including a fully-grown
   dragon!)
-  the whole thing feels empty; when the credits roll you murmur
   something along the lines of "is that it!"

On a more positive note, the final battle is rather intense, and I wish
it should have lasted longer. Otherwise there isn't much in this that
motivates me to go watch this 15-minute piece again. That this was done
with FLOSS is not grounds for a dishonest review.
