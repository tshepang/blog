(500) Days of Summer (2009)
===========================

Tries so hard to be fresh, and although its back-and-forth is unique, it
doesn't rescue the movie from being yet-another-romantic-drama. It's
ineffective, and there's nothing refreshing, and it's attempt at trying
to make it different makes it unbearable. I was surprised that it got
such `good ratings`_.

One fresh concept I gotta applaud is the Expectations/Reality thing,
where two scenes are put side-by-side, one real and one not.
