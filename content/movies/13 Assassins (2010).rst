13 Assassins (2010)
===================

A re-imagining of a [Seven Samurai[], complete with its Toshiro Mifune
(the forest guy who is looked-down upon for not being a samurai, and his
slight rebellion), its charismatic leader, battle and acting style (one
wouldn't guess that it was made only in 2010). The villain is
excessively brutal, more than any that Akira Kurosawa committed to
screen (if memory serves well). Luckily, the movie isn't soiled with the
silly characters that were so common in Akira's movies.
