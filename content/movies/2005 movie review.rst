**movie of the year** - *Kung Fu Hustle*

Not the best, but it's certainly the most memorable and definitely the
most entertaining. I couldn't get enough of it since I've done numerous
repeats of my favorite scenes. It's a showcase of tremendous (though
underutilized) talent but there's also many scenes and characters which
should have been excluded. Anyways, much of what one sees in here is
simply stuff of dreams, e.g.: we have a man catching a speeding bullet
with great ease, a very unsuspecting man at that, and dressed in pyjamas
and the cheapest of sandals, a man who soon meets his match...

The **runner-up**, the surreal `The Triplets of Belleville`_, portrays
rich human emotion (boredom and pain in this case), perhaps reaching
levels impossible with live action.

**best movie of the year** - *City of God*

Top-notch filmmaking skill deserving of a masterpiece; same goes for
camerawork and editing. All this makes for an exhilarating ride through
the unbelievably violent streets of Mexico City's slums. It's the kind
of movie which reminds me of a *Pulp Fiction* while remaining totally
different, except for a seeming fact that both directors relish in the
violence.

**performance of the year**

Li'l ZÃ©, the incredibly vicious villain in *City of God*. The runner-up
is Morgan Freeman's performance (his best so far) of a loser and
old-time boxer in *Million Dollar Baby* which ties with Kevin Spacey's
political activist in a superior `The Life of David Gale`_. A lesser, but
favorite, performance of mine is that of Laurence Fishburne in *Mystic
River*, proving that he shouldn't be in bad money vehicles like the two
sequels of *The Matrix*.

**spectacle of the year** - *The Island*

Great visuals and an
intriguing storyline help make this the year's greatest spectacle. The
runner-up happens to be *King Kong* for nobody has captured them
ritualistic humans so perfectly as Peter Jackson did here nor did anyone
ever commit such superb visual effects to screen. That's some explosive
shit, and I only wish the plausibility of the story was given some
thought. An honorable mention under this category is *The House of
Flying Daggers* for, even if didn't like the love triangle non-sense, I
haven't seen film battles quite captured like this before. Harks back to
a greater *Hero* which shared the same director, Zhang Yimou. Another
honorable mention goes to *The Incredibles* which happened to be the
most impressive of all 3D animated films so far, and also blessed with a
wonderful and fresh script.
