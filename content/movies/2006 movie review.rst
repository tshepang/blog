movie of the year
-----------------

*Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* for its visual splendour
and excitement. The runner-up in this category is `Shaolin Soccer`_,
which is made by the same guy who made 2005's movie of the year, *Kung
Fu Hustle*.

best movie
----------

`The Butterfly Effect`_ is the year's best movie, followed by `Birth`_.
There is stiff competition coming from the exciting and superb
*Confessions of A Dangerous Mind* as well as `Lord of War`_.
Such a listing convinces me that,
although the year wasn't as exciting,
it probably had more supreme movies compared to `2005`_.

spectacle of the year
---------------------

Nothing beats *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* in terms of
size, not to mention breath-taking effects.

performance of the year
-----------------------

Crispin Glover shines in a bizarre performance in the surreal *Dead
Man*. Another favorite of mine is the almost comic one of James Caan in
`Dogville`_, however the year's favorite is easily Eamonn Walker's
dictator in `Lord of War`_, a great highlight of an already brilliant
movie. I found the character portrayal of Tia Dalma, the witch in *Dead
Man's Chest*, the closest competitor to Eamonn Walker's character.

best female performance
-----------------------

Nicole Kidman's perplexed widow in `Birth`_ is her most intense and best
ever. The most touching of female performances however goes to Amy
Smart's in `The Butterfly Effect`_ for the part in which she's a wasted
waiter.

best male performance
---------------------

Jack Nicholson steals the screen away from the two leads of *Easy
Rider*, while John Malkovich is notable for *Ripley's Game*. Another
impressive, but overly self-conscious performance, is that for the
daring show host found in *V for Vendetta*.

best cast
---------

*Red Dragon* wins in this category due to luminous appearances from the
likes of Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Emily Watson, etc.

direction
---------

George Clooney really outdoes himself (even considering this is a debut)
in the beautifully-crafted *Confessions of A Dangerous Mind*. This is
not nearly the genius that is shown in Darren Aronofsky's `Pi`_, and
only masters wind up making electrifying fables like *A History of
Violence*.

beautiful imagery
-----------------

The festival depicted in *Ghost in the Shell 2* is breathtaking.
Runner-up is *Rize*'s well-sculpted climactic scene, the one in which
the performers dance to the sun with oil-covered skin, is so illustrious
the characters seem god-like.

irritating, disturbing
----------------------

*Life Aquatic* takes the lead here.

action movie
------------

Me not being comfortable about the fact that there weren't too many
competitors, *Assault on Precinct 13* still deserves attention for its
action (though it's no *Die Hard*) and good direction, even though it's
got nothing fresh.

scariest
--------

`Birth`_ wins for its edge-of-the-seat, slow thrills, well-enhanced by
its performances, owed to Nicole and the boy.

script
------

Only a genius could be held responsible for `The Butterfly Effect`_'s
superb, complex, and rich storyline. `Lord of War`_ deserves honorable
mention for its very fresh take on gun-running, which happened to be a
foreign idea to me.

prison depiction
----------------

This ain't no standard category, but nothing in my history of film
viewing beats what's shown in `The Butterfly Effect`_.

character design
----------------

The gorgeous designs in *A Corpse Bride* are breathtaking, but this only
applies to living humans and not the ghosts, which are too gimmicky for
my liking.

strangest movie
---------------

This honor goes to the weird *Dead Man* which has some very memorable
scenes; It also has the honor of being totally respected by
master-critic, Jonathan Rosenbaum.

cinematography
--------------

*Man on Fire*, with excellent, grainy touches and handheld camerawork,
is followed by *Constantine*'s gorgeous shots, *Delicatessen*'s
ultra-polished images and, to a lesser extent, *Tsotsi*'s shots of SA's
less pleasant living conditions.

music
-----

*Tsotsi*'s energetic Kwaito beats are well-executed, enhancing the
movie.

war movie
---------

*Tears of the Sun* shows the tough realities of African guerilla
warfare, distorted as it may be.

production design
-----------------

Tough competition sees *Constantine*, *Man on Fire*, *Spiderman 2*, and
*Tsotsi* battling without a clear winner.

visual effects
--------------

*Pirates of the Caribbean* is up there with *King Kong* among the
greatest ever visual spectacles. An honorable mention goes to *SpiderMan
2* and another to the lower-budget entrant, *Constantine*.

sound
-----

*The Ring* uses wonderful sound to achieve its scare effort and is
followed closely by *Man on Fire*.

editing
-------

Nothing beats *The Ring* here especially with the well-done flashbacks.
Runner-up is *Man on Fire*.

voice talent and voice-overs
----------------------------

One could watch *Sin City* just for the tough guy, deep male voices
heard throughout.

shit
----

*Star Wars III* has the worst editing, worst acting, worst sound, worst
direction, but got beaten by *Eurotrip* as worst movie.
