2007 movie review

Not such a good year at the movies if compared to `2005`_ and `2006`_,
and there's isn't even a single masterpiece.


movie of the year
-----------------

Nothing this year has had as much impact on me as has Mel Gibson's
`Apocalypto`_ given its gruelling tale of cruelty, the sort I never
witnessed before. The runner-up is *300* for its awe-inspiring visual
magnificence.

best movie of the year
----------------------

There was a number of very well-made movies this year, but none was as
good as `Smokin' Aces`_ for its exciting action and excellent direction.

enchanting
----------

*Polar Express* was made a number of years ago but it still packs a
punch in many of its moments especially the near-accident of the magic
train, the dance sequence of chocolate presentation, and the North pole
environment. These are possibly the most magical ever sequences in movie
history. *Ratatouille*, another fantasy, is a very enjoyable runner-up,
even given its formulaic touches, typical of so much animation out
there.

cinematography
--------------

`Munich`_ can't be beaten in this category for its flawlessly-polished
look. It is followed by a much smaller movie, *Three Colours Blue*, for
its beautiful usage of lighting.

production design
-----------------

It's rare that an old movie would impress this much due to its visual
aspects, but the design of the alien environment in *Alien* was
breath-taking. The runner-up happened to be *District B13* for its
rotting and crime-ridden urban setting.

cast
----

What helped make `Apocalypto`_ feel so real is its cast of unknowns; I
did not notice any misplacement or annoying performance. The runner-up
is the cast of *American Ganster* (and that does not include the two
leads). *Hot Fuzz* wins the title for comic cast.

performances
------------

My most favorite of all the year's performances goes to Taraji Henson
who plays an exciting, yet heartbreaking, role of a sniper in `Smokin'
Aces`_. The best female performance was however that of Anne Parillaud,
who plays the lead in *Sex is Comedy*, portraying a tough yet lovely
movie director. The performance is enhanced very well by her limp. As
for male performances, there's a tie between Anthony Hopkins in
`Fracture`_ and Forest Whitaker in *The Last King of Scotland*, which is
a pity because that was Forest's best ever performance while Anthony's
was business-as-usual. Mark Ruffalo's subdued but highly-focused
character in *Zodiac* is runner-up.

characters
----------

The best villain is Josh Brolin's dirty cop found in *American Ganster*
for its unflinching acts of corruption. My favorite character is Gerard
Butler's Spartan king in *300* while the most exotic is the Anjelina
Jolie's demon in `Beowulf`_. The most desirable gal is Rosamund Pike in
*Fracture* while Vera Farmica of *The Departed*, Ana Claudia Talancon'
in *El Crimen del Padro Amaro*, and Kerry Washington in *The Last King
of Scotland* are tied as runner-ups. Julianne Moore in *Next* is the
year's best detective given her unrelenting focus in getting the job
done. A special mention should go to John Heder's goofy and kind-hearted
ice skating champion in the delightful *Blades of Glory*.

visuals
-------

The year's greatest spectacle *Transformers* is also the year's best
visual effects showcase, and should have tied with the runner-up,
*Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End*, had it not been so
exciting. That runner-up would have won had it come up with something
more interesting than the stormy battle. *300* easily wins the year's
best imagery for being greatly stylized. *The Number 23* takes second
spot due to its gorgeous fantasy-like scenes. The most horrific
imagery emanates from *The Last King of Scotland*, a scene that
showcases the aftermath of the cheating wife.

action
------

The best action of any movie this year emanates from the gripping `The
Bourne Ultimatum`_, given its excellent execution and the relentless
dedication of the Bourne character, and his lead adversary. The best
action sequence is however to be found in the final battle in *The
Kingdom*. The best chase sequence is to be found in the very first scene
of *District B13*, where the very athletic hero saves his neck from some
very unloving fellows.

miscellaneous
-------------

`Munich`_ ties with *Cars* as regards the best sound and the
runner-up is *Fearless* for its battles. There's a tie between *The
Number 23* and *Lucky Number Slevin* (presentation of textual info and
the slick murders) as the best opening credits sequence. The runner-up
is *The Kingdom*, while the best closing credits is by *300*, with its
nice mix of 2D and 3D imagery. *Next* wins both most romantic scene (the
definition of beauty) and most painful scene (wheelchair explosion) even
though both their impact was painfully reduced on a revisit, while the
movie is runner-up as best concept (seeing the future in a mere 2
minutes), the winner in that category being *Dejavu*, which is the best
treatment I've ever seen of time-travel, though the movie itself sucks
much. 2nd runner-up happens to be *Solaris*, whose concept is
reminiscent of that of *Sphere* and therefore not so fresh. *Solaris* is
also runner-up for most surreal, winner by far being the unbearably
weird *The Fountain*. *The Last King of Scotland* had the best music
while `Apocalypto`_ had the best costume design. *Fearless*' battle on
the elevated platform was the best fight while *Five Fingers* had the
best twist. The most overrated movie turns out to be *Vertigo*, which
frequently appears in many elevated lists of the all-time greatest
movies. Instead of a landmark, I saw a badly-acted old-time thriller,
not a bit better than those Humphrey Bogart flicks.
The runner-up is *The Searchers* which lacked anything commendable,
bar some nice images during the final battle.

special mention
---------------

Something like *Alpha Dog* has not quite been done before and therefore
maintains amazing levels of freshness given various moments (the angry
telephone call, Justin Timberlake's cool) even though it remains
pointless. Another special mention should go to *Devil's Rejects* for
its crazy storyline of killers-for-fun and gruesome violence,
reminiscent of *Natural Born Killers*.

best first-time viewing experiences
-----------------------------------

As anyone knows and as seen many times above, movies never offer the
same experience when revisited. So here's a listing of those which were
most impressive on first viewing in order of which had the most impact:
`Apocalypto`_, *Fearless*, *300*, *Next*.
