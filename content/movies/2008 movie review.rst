2008 movie review
=================

movie of the year
-----------------

`Cloverfield`_ is the year's greatest spectacle, with the inventive
style popularised by *The Blair Witch Project*, and sweetened with the
year's best visual effects and superb sound. An honorable mention goes
to `Taken`_ while the most innovative concept is the unique time-travel
story of `The Lake House`_.

best movie
----------

`Children of Men`_ easily takes this one.

direction
---------

Nothing was done better than `Children of Men`_, followed by `No Country
for Old Men`_.

misc elements
-------------

Best comedy is *Knocked Up*, best romantic drama is *Friends With
Money*, while nothing was quite as enchanting as the feel-good
socio-political `Hairspray`_. Therunner-up is the formulaic, yet
effective, *Robots*.

Nothing made me cry in my history of movie-watching as did the drama,
`Kinsey`_, and there wasn't a movie as bizarre as `Persona`_, while the
year's best dialogue can be found in `The Squid & the Whale`_.

As for production design, nothing beat `No Country for Old Men`_, while
*TMNT* is a runner-up, animated as it is. *No Country for Old Men* also
got the year's best sound, followed by a tie between `30 Days of Night`_
and *Cloverfield*. `The New World`_'s editing is the year's most
accomplished.

The best dancing can be found in `Step Up 2: The Streets`_, there's no
better action-thriller than `Taken`_ (followed by `Shooter`_), while no
horror is better than the chilling `Vacancy`_. The best action is found
in `Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children`_, followed by `Kung Fu Panda`_.
The best fight is between the characters played by Jet Li and Jacky Chan
in the otherwise shitty and silly `The Forbidden Kingdom`_.

misc small things
-----------------

The year's best escape was the villain's in *Kung Fu Panda*, followed by
that from the 'safe house' in *Children of Men*, which also happens to
have the best battle scene. The best confrontation was that of the
characters of Craig Bierko and Russel Crowe in a party scene in *The
Cinderella Man*. The best end-credits sequence finds a tie between
*Cloverfield*'s VHS-style and *The Mummy*'s which uses a concept copied
from *300*'s end-credits sequence.

*The Condemned* had my favorite sexual interaction (very brief but
complete with beautiful comic touches) and I don't remember a car crash
in movie history as great as that in *Death Proof*.

performances
------------

The year's performance is easily Heath Ledger's in *The Dark Knight*,
and he happens to be the movie's sole redeemer, almost. Other
outstanding male performers are Josh Brolin in `Planet Terror`_, Cuba
Gooding, Jr.'s as dirty cop in *Dirty*, John Carrol Lynch's bit
appearance in `Confidence`_, and then Stanley Tucci's fashion lover in
*The Devil Wears Prada*. My favorite comic performance is William H.
Macy's in *Wild Hogs*.

The best female perfomance was by Cate Blanchett's title character as a
daring journalist in *Veronica Guerin*, followed by the surprisingly
excellent Kerry Washington as a slutty girl in *I Think I Love My Wife*.
Ger Ryan (2nd runner-up) really touched me as a loving mother in
*interMission* followed by Ellen Barkin (3rd runner-up) in *Someone Like
You*. That Ger Ryan also ties with Ellen Page's appearance in the
horrifying *Hard Candy* as my favorite female performance. They are
followed by Clare-Hope Ashitey's key role in *Children of Men* and then
a tie (2nd runner-up) between Katie Holmes' thief in *Mad Money* and
Q'Orianka Kilcher's Pocahontas in `The New World`_. The best bit-female
performance is Alexandra Silber's book lover in *Room 1408* which is the
best thing in the movie even though she appears in just one short scene.

The best cast is a tie between *interMission* (a bunch of memorable and
eccentric characters) and `No Country for Old Men`_ (a small solid set
of rural American characters). The runner-ups is a tie between *Friends
With Money* (very honest and fresh performances) and *The Lookout*. The
best characterisations was in `The New World`_ for the colorful portrayal
of the Native Americans.

characters
----------

The **best villain** is Heath Ledger's The Joker in *The Dark Knight*,
who is also my most favorite ever. He is followed by Sid Haig's homorous
clown in *House of A Thousand Corpses*.

The most desirable gal is Emelia Burns, the black girl in *The
Condemned*. She's followed by Cate Blanchett in *Veronica Guerin* and
then Shirley Henderson as the emotionally-hurt girl in *interMission*.

There were no characters as cute the young penguins in *Surf's Up*.

My most **favorite creature** is the super-large monster in
*Cloverfield*, followed by Pyramid Head in `Silent Hill`_.
2nd runner-up is the hyperrealistic mountain creatures in
*The Mummy 3*. The best **character design** however goes to the
villainous Maltazard in *Arthur & the Invisibles*, followed by the three
suits in *Iron Man*.

visuals
-------

The year's most beautiful imagery can be found in *Surf's Up* (the waves
and the hidden beach), with an honorable mention going to *The Bank
Job*, especially its opening scene. *Appleseed* has the year's best visuals.
