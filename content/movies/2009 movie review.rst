2009 movie review
=================

:date: 2010-01-01
:tags: year-movie-review



The year started with a whole lot of stellar performers but slowed down
later on since I did things other than watch movies. Regardless, that
early period represented some of the best movie years in recent memory.

movie of the year
-----------------

The portrayal of a quiet hero in `Zatoichi`_ is spot-on, and the
runner-up, the super-fresh `District 9`_, is the best movie to ever come
out of South Africa.

best movie
----------

The year's best movie is `Baise-moi`_, whose unflinching and unsettling
violence has the raw intensity of `Bamboozled`_'s climax and the
harshness of *Natural Born Killers*, without the humor. First runner-up
is `Changeling`_, and second runner-up is `District 9`_.

performances
------------

My favorite performances are a tie and all go to one movie, `Watchmen`_
— Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley when face
is unmasked. Runner-up is `Raffaëla Anderson`_ as a crazed rape victim
in `Baise-moi`_.

There was quite a number of superb male performances, the best being
Daniel-Day Lewis' near-flawless oil miner in `There Will Be Blood`_,
followed by John Malkovich's activist in `Changeling`_, followed by the
ever-magnificent Jack Nicholson's grumpy tycoon in Bucket List, while
3rd runner-up is a tie between Woody Harrelson's blind man in `Seven
Pounds`_ and Robert Duvall's unscrupulous media man in `Network`_.

The year's best female performance came from Anjelina Jolie's grieving
victim in Changeling followed by a tie between Rosario Dawson's love
interest in `Seven Pounds`_, Faye Dunaway's fast-talking media lady in
`Network`_, and Tilda Swinton's fleeting lover in `The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button`_.

characters
----------

Compared to last year, this year is lacklustre, except for desirable
gals where Golshifteh Farahani (`Body of Lies`_) and husky voice (likely
Brenda Vaccaro) in `Midnight Cowboy`_ take the crown. 1st runner-up is
leading lady, Zhao Tao, in `Still Life`_ followed by (cheat) the warrior
girl in `Avatar`_, who/which also happens to be year's **best creature**.

Character design goes to the talking toys of `Small Soldiers`_.

Due to a lack of a worthy villain, I'll crown `Changeling`_'s police
force as the year's best for their unbearable acts of cruelty.

visuals
~~~~~~~

`2012`_ has some seriously explosive visual effects, among the best
ever. The runner-ups:

1. `Transformers 2`_
2. `Avatar`_
3. `District 9`_

The best visual effects artefact is the robo-bikes in `Terminator
Salvation`_, which ties with the exo-suit in `District 9`_.

misc elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As regards the year's **best direction**, I can't decide who wins
between `Changeling`_ and `There Will Be Blood`_. As for **best
production design**, `Changeling`_ wins, and its runner-up is `Shoot 'Em
Up`_. You will notice that *Changeling* gets more accolades than any
other movie this year, and includes the **best costume design**, and the
**best cast**. *Shoot 'Em Up* scoops **best cinematography**.

The year's greatest spectacles are *2012* and `Avatar`_; best thriller
is `Law-Abiding Citizen`_; most original movie, or one that feels so, is
`District 9`_; best comedy is `You Don't Mess With the Zohan`_; the most
enchanting/delightful is `Wall-E`_, followed up by `Sponge Bob`_.

The year's **best action** movie is `Quantum of Solace`_, followed by
`Avatar`_; the most bizarre is `Ghost Dog`_, followed by `Watchmen`_;
the funniest is *You Don't Mess With the Zohan*, followed by *Yes Man*,
then `Monsters vs. Aliens`_.

The **most touching** movie (overall) is `Yellow Earth`_, a sad
exploration of a hopeless yearning for freedom, which presents itself in
a form of Communist soldier with a weird mission. The **most touching
moments** is the relationship between the Chinese and Russian lady in
`The World`_, followed by a childish romance between silly tent
constructor and sweet servant in *Monsoon Wedding*.

The **best opening credits sequence** is in `Rock 'n Rolla`_. The
**worst humiliation** is in near the end of `There Will Be Blood`_.
