2010 movie review
=================

:date: 2011-01-01
:tags: year-movie-review



The **best movie** I have seen this year is `Precious`_, and runner-up
is `Somewhere`_. The year's **greatest spectacle**, however, is
`Inception`_, followed by `The A-Team`_. The best **direction** is
`Precious`_, followed by a tie between `Brooklyn's Finest`_ and
`Somewhere`_.

visuals
-------

The best **cinematography** can be seen in `An Education`_, followed by
`The Social Network`_. The best **visual effects** can be seen in
`Inception`_, and the best **production design** can be seen in *Death
At A Funeral*... the interior of that home is wonderful. The best
**editing** can be seen in `The Kite Runner`_, and the best
**animation** in *How To Train A Dragon*. The best **opening credits
sequence** is in *Up in the Air*, followed by *An Education*.

miscellaneous
-------------

The best **adventure** movie is *Prince of Persia*, the best **horror**,
*Call Back*, and the most **painful**, `Precious`_, followed by *The
Magdalene Sisters*. The **funniest** is *Get Smart*, and most
**enchanting** is *Alice In Wonderland*. The best **action direction**
is in `Takers`_.

The best **script/dialogue** is a tie between `Memento`_ and
`Precious`_, followed by `The Social Network`_. The best **narration**
can be found in the most **bizarre** movie of the year, *Sita Sings the
Blues*. There was nothing more **moody** than *Anamorph*.

The best **sound** is a tie between *Up in the Air* and `Somewhere`_.

acting & characters
-------------------

There were so many enjoyable performances this year that I couln't
clearly decide who was better than who, and here's an attempt:

The year's most **favorite performance** is that of Jesse Eisenberg in
(`The Social Network`_), followed by:

1. a tie between Stanley Tucci & Patricia Clarkson (*Easy A*); Amina
   Robinson's scarface, Xosha Roquemore's never-serious classmate, Chyna
   Layne's Jamaican classmate (`Precious`_)
2. Ron Perlman (`The Job`_)
3. homo guy (*Woman On Top*); John Cleese (*Spud*); friend (*Lottery
   Ticket*)

In the category of **best male performance**, Guy Pearce (`Memento`_)
ties with Woody Harrelson (*The Messenger*).

As for **best female performance**, many would consider this heresy, but
I find that Meryl Streep in `Sophie's Choice`_ ties with Mo'Nique in
[Precious][1]. Runner-up is Carrie-Anne Moss in `Memento`_, her best
performance so far.

The sole winner in the category of **character development** is
`Precious`_, with classmates, the teacher's lover, and the mother
(Mo'Nique).

My most **favorite character** is the admirable Nelson Mandela (played
by Morgan Freeman) in (`Invictus`_). Runner-up is Rosalind Pike's
superbly gorgeous but dumb-ass blonde in (`An Education`_).

The **best child performance** was by the girl palying the daughter in
(`Somewhere`_), followed by title character in *Spud*.

The best **cast** can be found in `Precious`_. It also so happens to be
the best cast of any movie I've seen yet. Amazing shit right there.
Runner-up is the cast of `An Education`_, followed by that of *Calendar
Girls*.

The best **cast of children** can be found in *Spud*, while the most
**heroic character** is that of Anjelina Jolie's secret agent in
`Salt`_.

The year's best **villain** is that played by Mo'Nique in `Precious`_.
Here's the runner-ups:

1. Hades (`Clash of the Titans`_) – also the year's most fearsome
2. `Iron Man 2`_
3. tough and smart shooter (`The A-Team`_)

The most **desirable gal** is cheat, having multiple characters. It's
the classmates in `Precious`_, best of which is scarface. Oh man, why do
people have to look and be like her. Damn!

Here's the follow-ups:

1. Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air) and Lois character (`Superman`_)
2. lover (Last Tango in Paris); Maggie Gyllenhaal (*Crazy Heart*)
3. bride (*Mamma Mia*); huge eyes (*Outsourced*)
4. police lady (*Holy Water*)

The most **miserable character** was that of Philip Seymour Hoffman in
*Synecdoche, New York*, which isn't very surpsring since such characters
are his trademark. He's followed very closely by Marlon Brando's in the
disturbing *Last Tango in Paris*.

The best **character design** is the bizarre cyborg trio in `Afro
Samurai: Resurrection`_, followed by Hades, the villain in `Clash of the
Titans`_.

The most **charming character** is the cat in *Secret of Kells*. Also,
its eyes reminds me too much of a gal I intensely obsessed over some
years ago.

The most **perfect gentleman** is hubby to Julia (*Julie & Julia*),
played by Stanley Tucci. Runner-up is the oh-so-perfect groom character
in *Our Family Wedding*.

The **koolest guy** is Mark Wahlberg's in *Date Night*, followed by
Justin Timberlake's in `The Social Network`_.

The best character development ever for a **nerd** can be found in
*Shopgirl*, in a form of an inept lover. As for this year, this is
followed by the schoolboy in `An Education`_. As is so common, both
character's shortcomings involve girls.

Here's a list of most **painful/touching scene**:

1. strapped with bombs (`The Hurt Locker`_)
2. death by insulin (`Memento`_)
3. hate for a dead wife (*Last Tango in Paris*) – leads one sympathising
   with the otherwise unpleasant character
4. expression of love between cop and prostitute (`Brooklyn's Finest`_)

The best **dance scene** is the dark, yet enchanting puppet mastery
sequence in *Chicago*. The best **sci-fi set** is the white ship
interior in *Resident Evil Afterlife*, the best **warfare** is in
*Centurion*, the best **story concept** is in `Memento`_, followed by
`Inception`_.

Each repeat of a movie is a different experience, hence this category of
**best first-time viewing experience**. This year, it is won by `Iron
Man 2`_, which failed on the rewatch value department. Runner-up is the
masterful `Precious`_.

'old' movies
------------

This section is meant to give a chance to movies I have watched before
this year to appear in this review, for one reason or another.

Of those, the **best experience** was offered by `Smokin' Aces`_, which
has now been elevated to a [near-masterpiece][]. Runner-up is *Reservoir
Dogs*, which remains fresh and exciting after all these years... a rare
quality for a movie indeed.

The **fall from glory** award goes to:

1. `Se7en`_ - lost its juice on this revisit
2. `Malcolm X`_ - I considered this a masterpiece at some point
3. `Human Nature`_ - same as above

unpleasantries
--------------

The most **boring** movie this year is *A Brighter Summer Day*, followed
by *Afterwards* (no pun intended). The most **overrated** movie is
`Shane`_ (dull and lame), followed by *Up*, which doesn't live anywhere
near the high expectations worthy of animated movies of its stature. The
most **overrated villain** is Jack Nicholson as The Joker in `Batman`_.
WTF!
