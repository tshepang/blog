2011 movie review
=================

:date: 2012-01-01
:tags: year-movie-review



I was very surprised when I went through a list of movies I tagged as
excellent, which I watched first time in 2011, and found several. One
problem though is that I can't rank them because I don't fully remember
the experiences of all. Luckily, I know which of the movies are at the
top:

1. `Megamind`_.
2. `4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days`_ (tie) `Crimson Gold`_

The ranking of those taking second spot may very well be careless
because I only watched them once, but the impact they had on me is still
vivid, so they stay, at least for now.

Here's the rest (ranked alphabetically):

-  `The Cat In The Hat`_ (a case where I drastically differ with general
   critical approval)
-  `Downfall`_
-  `Kung Fu Panda 2`_ (also happens to be the year's **greatest
   spectacle**)
-  `Rabbit Hole`_
-  `Sex, Lies, and Videotape`_
-  `Tangled`_
-  `Unknown`_

visuals
-------

A ranking of the year's **best cinematography**:

1. `The Seventh Seal`_
2. `The Kings's Speech`_
3. `Shelter`_
4. `Orphan`_

As for the year's **best production design**, there is a tie between
`The Kings's Speech`_ and `Shelter`_.

The year's **best visual effects (overall)**:

1. `The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader`_
2. `Sucker Punch`_
3. a tie between `Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief`_
   and `Tron: Legacy`_
4. it would be sinful not to include [Transformers: Dark of the Moon][],
   even though it's pretty much the same offering as the 2 previous
   offerings in the franchise.

The year's **best visual effects (specific moments)**:

1. train crash (`Super 8`_)
2. river-god (`The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian`_)
3. sea monster (`The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn
   Treader`_)
4. wall of water (`The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn
   Treader`_)
5. Paris chase by the 2 `exoskeletons`_ (`G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra`_)
6. the storm (`Gulliver's Travels`_)
7. trash in the recycling plant (`Toy Story 3`_) — maybe a cheat since
   this is animation, but I needed to mention it

The year's **best animation** is a tie between `Rango`_ and `Legend of
the Guardians`_. Both offer lengthy moments of hyper-realistic imagery.
The runner-up is `9`_ with it's wonderful action sequences.

Although the **best action** is offered by `9`_, the **best action
sequence** is the `exoskeleton`_ chase in `G.I. Joe: The Rise of
Cobra`_. However, there **most innovative sequence** is the split-screen
bounty hunter scene found in `The Green Hornet`_.

performances
------------

My **favorite performance** is that of `Andie MacDowell`_ when playing
the sweet love interest in `Sex, Lies, and Videotape`_. First runner-up
is a tie between Vera Farmica as sad mother (`Orphan`_) and `Jon de
Lancie`_ as lead of pathology (`Pathology`_). 2nd runner-up is Sandra Oh
(`Rabbit Hole`_).

The **best male performance** is by Geoffrey Rush when playing a
therapist in `The Kings's Speech`_. Here's the runner-ups:

1. `Miles Teller`_ (`Rabbit Hole`_)
2. Laurence Fishburne (`Contagion`_)
3. Sean Penn (`Fair Game`_)
4. `Lennie James`_ (`The Next Three Days`_)
5. `Russell Brand`_ (`Get Him to the Greek`_)

The **best female performance** is by Nicole Kidman in `Rabbit Hole`_,
and the **best cast** is from the same movie. Maybe it's a distant
second, but the runner-up on that category is `Pathology`_. The **best
voice talent** is that of `Rango`_.

characters
----------

As regards the **best character development**, James Spader's
free-spirited character in `Sex, Lies, and Videotape`_ ties with Nicole
Kidman's grieving asshole in `Rabbit Hole`_. Runner-up is the evil
peacock in `Kung Fu Panda 2`_.

The **best villain** is the peacock in `Kung Fu Panda 2`_. He was truly
evil yet his demeanor, often humorous, made us care about him.

The **best character design** is that of the main villain in `9`_,
followed by the ninjas in `The Warrior's Way`_.

The year's **most desirable gal** is `Sandra Oh`_ in `Rabbit Hole`_,
playing a small role as the love interest. Watching this has changed my
view of her... I want her, now! Here's the (multiple) runner-ups:

1. `Andie MacDowell`_ (`Sex, Lies, and Videotape`_)
2. `Shirley MacLaine`_ (`Being There`_)
3. `Teri Hatcher`_ (`Tango & Cash`_)
4. `Jill Schoelen`_ `The Stepfather`_

`According to Greta`_ boasts both the **most perfect gentleman** (the
lead's boyfriend) and the **most perfect father** (the lead's grandpa).

I was impressed by Lennie James in `The Next Three Days`_, making him
the year's **favorite detective**.

The **best comic character** is the fat guy in `She's Out of My
League`_, followed by a tie between Jack Black's partner in `Nacho
Libre`_ and the fat oversexed woman in `Nanny McPhee And The Big Bang`_.

miscellaneous
-------------

In order to recognize movies that deliver certain ideas/messages I find
most important, I am making a new category, the **most important
movie**. The harmful effects of making abortion illegal are portrayed in
a very powerful way in `4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days`_, and that easily
makes the move the winner. There's a tie between the 2 runners-ups:

-  `Fair Game`_ (harmful suppression of truth by powerful government
   officials)
-  `Contagion`_ (a reminder of how fragile our existence is, and the
   social chaos that can result from desperation and fear)

Each repeat of a movie is a different experience, hence this category of
**best first-time viewing experience**. It's won by `Megamind`_ (blew my
mind away due to its seeming perfection) and the runner-up is `Shrek
Forever After`_, which sadly couldn't survive a revisit.

The **worst revisit** was `Shrek Forever After`_. I deemed it a
near-masterpiece on first viewing, but it seemed a different (and worse)
movie on a revisit. Not that it was trash. It was just not very good.
The runner-up is `The Warrior's Way`_.

As for the year's **best script/dialog**, there is a tie between `Sex,
Lies, and Videotape`_ and `Contagion`_. The runner-up is `Fair Game`_.

The year's **funniest movie** is `Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey`_. The
first runner-up is `Being There`_, while its three 2nd runner-ups are a
tie: `Brewster's Millions`_ (surprising entrant), `The Cat In The Hat`_,
and `Semi-Pro`_.

The year's **most enchanting** movie is `Megamind`_, followed by
`Tangled`_.

The year's **most original story** is that of **The Idiots** (the
subject matter of conmen is fairly popular yes, but in here is the added
twist of the perpetrators not having any material gain out of it). The
runner-up is `Dark Matter`_, followed by `Pathology`_.

I don't really pay much attention to this one, but I'll give the **best
make-up** honor to `Pathology`_ for making corpses look so convincing.

The **most overrated** movie is `Sunset Boulevard`_ followed by `All
About Eve`_. The former is substandard while the second is quite decent.

'old' movies
------------

This section is meant to give a chance to movies I have watched before
this year to appear in this review, for one reason or another.

Of those, the **best experience** was offered by the masterpiece,
`Requiem for A Dream`_. It was almost a surprise that the intensity of
the experience was as great as was on first viewing, a very rare
quality.

Here's the runner-ups:

1. `Mandingo`_ – the best movie on US slavery I've seen yet
2. `The Bourne Supremacy`_ – among the best action thrillers I've seen
   yet
3. `Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure`_, whose continued excellence and
   humor surprised me, it being a childhood favorite, and also being
   made in the 80's (a bad decade for movies).
