2012 movie review
=================

:date: 2013-01-01
:tags: year-movie-review



It is a pity that this year lacks any excellent movies, never mind a
masterpiece. This makes `last year`_, which was a great year, by far
better, and this among the worst. This does not mean there was nothing
to celebrate of course.

visuals
-------

The best **visual effects (overall)**:

1. `The Avengers`_
2. `Battleship`_
3. `Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix`_

In terms of specifics, there was nothing better than the battle between
Voldermort and Dumbledore in that last listing, and the climactic battle
in `The Avengers`_ is runner-up.

The best **action** is offered by `The Bourne Legacy`_, and `The
Avengers`_ is its runner-up.

The best **hand-to-hand combat sequence** is the fight that takes place
in a diner in `Haywire`_, followed by the protagonist fighting 2
assasins in `The Bourne Legacy`_.

The best **animation** is, interestingly, is an insert in (`Harry Potter
and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1`_), which tells the story of the Deathly
Hallows.

The best **opening credits sequence/visuals** are from `True Legend`_,
followed by those from `The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo`_. As for best
**ending credits sequence/visuals**, the honor goes to `Harry Potter and
the Half-Blood Prince`_.

Although I hate the movie, I have to admit that **best production
design** is found in `J. Edgar`_.

performances
------------

My **favorite performance** is that of Patrick Shai in `The Bang Bang
Club`_. This is extra special since the guy comes from my country. The
runner-ups are Charlotte Gainsbourg (`The Science of Sleep`_), followed
by the crippled guy in `Battleship`_.

The **best female performance** is a tie between Annette Bening &
Julianne Moore in `The Kids Are All Right`_. Runner-up is Charlotte
Gainsbourg in `The Science of Sleep`_, who is just about the movie's
saving grace.

The best **child performance** is by Dakota Goyo, the son in `Real
Steel`_, while the best **cast** is in `The Iron Lady`_.

My favorite **voice acting** is Tom Hardy (Bane) (`The Dark Knight
Rises`_), even though it's hard to hear at times.

characters
----------

The best **character development** is the father of the title character
(Jack Lemmon) in `Missing`_, followed by the wife (Sissy Spacek) in the
same movie. My **favorite character** is however the son (`Dakota
Goyo`_) in (`Real Steel`_.

My **favorite villain** is the witch (Eva Green) in `Dark Shadows`_,
runner-up being Bane (Tom Hardy) in `The Dark Knight Rises`_.

The most **desirable gal** is Charlotte Gainsbourg as main love interest
`The Science of Sleep`_ (I really loved this girl right?). Here are the
runner-ups:

1. Brooke White as wife and new mother (`Change of Plans`_)
2. Sissy Spacek as wife (`Missing`_)
3. Rebecca Hall as breast inspection worker (`Please Give`_)

The **best character design** is the Chitauri, the alien race in `The
Avengers`_.

The best **comic characters**:

1. Ken Jeong (`The Hangover Part II`_)
2. Lucy Punch (`Bad Teacher`_)
3. Justin Timberlake (`Bad Teacher`_) (tie) master butler (`Bob the
   Butler`_)
4. Ben Stiller (`Zoolander`_)

The **worst asshole** was Marlon Brando's character in `A Streetcar
Named Desire`_.

miscellaneous
-------------

The most **funny** movies:

1. `The Dictator`_
2. `Horrible Bosses`_
3. `The Hangover Part II`_
4. `Zoolander`_

The best **script/dialogue** is in `Missing`_, followed by `Please
Give`_.

The best **costume design** comes, surprisingly, from `The Great
Dictator`_.

Each repeat of a movie is a different experience, hence this category of
**best first-time viewing experience**. This year, it's won by the
year's **greatest spectacle**, `The Avengers`_. Runner-up is `Gone Baby
Gone`_, and that's because it was so gripping that I thought it would be
a great contender for best movie of the year. A revisit was not so
great.

The most **bizarre** movie is `Battle In Heaven`_, and the **false
promise** award goes to `Zombieland`_. It wins for being so exciting and
sorta fresh when it starts, but screwing up with lack of content later
on.

The most **overrated** movie is `A Nightmare on Elm Street`_, followed
by `A Streetcar Named Desire`_. That second is hailed a masterpice by
weird people.

'old' movies
------------

This section is meant to give a chance to movies I have watched before
this year to appear in this review, for one reason or another.

Of those, the **best experience** was offered by `Being John
Malkovich`_, which has now been elevated to a `near-masterpiece`_.
Runner-up is `Taken`_, which remains as intense and exciting as ever.

The **fall from glory** award goes to:

-  `Vicky Cristina Barcelona`_: I enjoyed this massively first time I
   watched it 2 years ago; it now feels pretentious and cheap/shallow
   paradies, like something I would write if I were to try.

-  `Perfume`_: It is sad that I used to consider this a
   near-masterpiece. It remains good, just nowhere near the top.
