This year was rather sad: I didn\'t see any fresh movie (movies I saw
first time) above **good** rating (5/7). That is, there wasn\'t anything
at the excellent level (6/7), never mind a masterpiece (7/7). That also
means nothing stood out enough to be labeled **best movie of the year**.
Regardless, there was still much to celebrate. Let\'s see.

visuals
=======

The best **production design** is in [Doubt], followed by [The Iceman].

The best **visual design** is in [Upside Down], followed by [The Hunger
Games: Catching Fire].

The best **cinematography** is in [Doubt], also followed by [The
Iceman].

The best **visual effects** are in [Thor: The Dark World], followed by
[Transformers: Age of Extinction], then [Edge of Tomorrow].

performances
============

My **favorite performance** is by [Laurence R. Harvey] as the disgusting
(and evil) security guard in [The Human Centipede 2]. However, here are
the **best male performances**:

1.  [Michael Shannon] in [The Iceman]
2.  Anthony Hopkins in [Red 2]
3.  [Tom Wilkinson] in [Good People]
4.  Geoffrey Rush in [The Book Thief]
5.  Michael Shannon (repeat appearance) in [Premium Rush]
6.  Brad Pitt in [The Counselor]

The **best female performance** was given by [Susanne Lothar] in [Funny
Games], followed by [Julia Louis-Dreyfus] in [Enough Said]. In third
place is Emily Watson in [The Book Thief].

characters
==========

My **favorite character** is the adoptive father in [The Book Thief],
played by Geoffrey Rush. He\'s followed by the charming China Doll in
*Oz the Great and Powerful*, which is about as cute and lovable as
characters get. In third place is Valka, the mother of the lead
character in [How To Train Your Dragon 2].

The most **desirable gal** is [Dania Ramirez] in [Premium Rush]

There was no better **character design** than the giant samurai robot in
[The Wolverine]. In second place is the Alpha dragon from [How To Train
Your Dragon 2].

In terms of **character development**, nothing beats [Enough Said].

miscellaneous
=============

There was no **direction** better than [Funny Games], the best
**script/dialogue** can be found in [Enough Said], and There was no
greater **spectacle** than [Edge of Tomorrow].

The following have the best **story concept**:

1.  [Upside Down]
2.  [In Time]
3.  [The Adjustment Bureau]
4.  [Her]
5.  [The Purge: Anarchy]
6.  [13 Sins]

The **WTF** of the year: the guy who directed a very unimpressive [The
Butler] is the same one who made [Precious], which [one of the best
movies in history]. Really, WTF happened there!
