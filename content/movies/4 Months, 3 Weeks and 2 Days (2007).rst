4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days (2007)

Done with the style of `*Crimson Gold*`_, it's a superbly-made and
-acted movie about the ravages of poverty and the problems associated
with making abortion illegal. The general ill-treatment people give each
other is horrid, but luckily things are lightened up when our hero's
boyfriend celebrates mom's birthday (even though there's a sour note).
And the mom gives quite a good performance (and so does everyone else).

As for the comparison with *Crimson Gold*, it has far better acting, but
doesn't cover as much ground and is therefore simpler. I can't decide
which is superior between the two, but *Crimson Gold* had a stronger
emotional impact on me. Maybe that makes it a better movie.
