A weird post-apocalypse movie about bizarre puppet-like creatures trying
to survive in a world where they are terrorised by some scary robot
whose goal is left untold. The action is top-class and the adventure
heavy, with many cliffhanger moments, but the central premise (mentioned
in the twist) is damn silly. Character design is pretty good (the main
villain is awesome and so are its minions) while character development
is typical.
