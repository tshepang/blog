A History Of Violence (2005)
============================

Well-made and interesting, but pointless. Maria Bello is as good as usual
while Virgo Mortensen gives a poor performance. The kid playing their son
is impressive, and so was the brutal duo, who ended up trying to rob
the wrong guy. The movie is also saved by the fact that I'm impressed by
characters with great skill.
