One more reason I should probably stop paying attention to the opinions
of critics who get aggregated on Rotten Tomatoes. Most of those who
reviewed the movie actually felt `it was decent`_. One even went as far
as thinking the performances were any good. What the fuck! I will be
fair by admitting that the concept is actually good: people getting
attacked only when they fall asleep. I also liked some of the visuals,
like the gal who spins around and gets dragged around the room, defying
gravity. Everything else is plain bad, including the extremely
uninspired look and character development of the villain.
