A Prophet (2009)
================

Some serious storytelling here and is unlike anything I've seen before,
other than a resemlance to the mini-series, *Blood In, Blood Out*. An
epic prison movie, though something I don't really wanna see again.
There's very little happy things going on. There's a beautiful visual
(the accident) and an interesting concept (one guy taking on a few
gunmen).

The problem with movies is that they tend to go through different
episodes, which sadly often don't quite compare to each other. This
situation is worse for long movies like this one (3hrs). The setup
intense is quite intense. It's so good that I was expecting more than
what ultimately transpired (the slow rise of our 'hero' through the
ranks, and the complex politics surrounding him). It's good direction,
but it could have been better, and this lead of hours, although he
competently leads the movie, falls short at times. Reminds me of Liam
Neeson in *Schindler's List*.
