A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)
===============================

The direction is shitty and the performances unbearably-irritating, most
especially the mentally-challended leading character (by Vivien Leigh).
As if that's not enough, there's also a horrible asshole played Marlon
Brando. The only believable character is that of the lady upstairs,
though she isn't given much screen time.

This is among the most irritatingly-unbearable movies I've yet seen. How
the movie, and its performances, got so much praise is hard to fathom.
What the fuck!
