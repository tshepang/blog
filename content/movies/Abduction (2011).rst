Abduction (2011)
================

Takes forever to start, and the delay isn't filled with good filmmaking,
the only thing keeping me persevering being the John Singleton credit as
director. There's some bad acting (lead, his gal, and best friend) and
some interesting ones (Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver), some shitty
story and kiddy romance, and little else that's positive.
