According to Greta (2009)
=========================

It's well-made and has decent acting, but offers nothing new, with the
lead's assholeness levels unbearable, and for far too long. The
boyfriend is given a nice (though not too skilled) performance and so is
the grandpa. The diary visual effects are nice (but I've seen them
elsewhere before). The message the movie offers, compassion, is
delivered quite well, although it's made in an unconvincing manner (it's
like fantasy).
