The character design (from the title character to the colorful trio of
cyborgs) is quite good. The action fight choreography is among the most
brutal and intense I've yet seen, though it is often hard to figure what
is happening, a trick that is too common in action movies. The movie
also possesses a curious (and effective) mixture of two worlds foreign
to each other, hip-hop and oriental martial arts culture. It's nicely
spiced with the Samuel L. Jackson character, which helps bring some
humanity to an otherwise dark and horrid storyline.
