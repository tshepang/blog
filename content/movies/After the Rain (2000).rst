After the Rain (2000)
=====================

I enjoyed the duels, especially the bloody one (the only such in the
movie). I enjoyed the music, singing, and rejoicing of the poor people
in the inn even more. The greatest moment in the movie, one thing that
brought tear to eye, is the act of kindness that the lead character
showed toward the unruly and disliked prostitute.

The wife of the lead is a badly-developed character. The attempt to make
her angelic is nearly ludicrous, and the performer isn't skilled enough
to help achieve the goal.
Another bad character, though to a lesser extent,
is the political leader. His portrayal is too fierce to convince.

Otherwise, the movie is rather empty.
