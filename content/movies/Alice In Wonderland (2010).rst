Alice In Wonderland (2010)
==========================

There's a number of enchanting moments, and Alice is sweet to the eye;
she is also lovely in battle costume and battle movement;
the hatter is at times fun (my favorite moment, also the saddest,
is when exclaiming how good it would be that he dies looking good);
the evil queen is the most interesting of all,
despite the fact that her deeds are at times too evil to swallow
(e.g. her usage of an animal as a golf ball, or her
castle being surrounded by heads she severed).
The movie however feels
rushed and the characters underdeveloped.
