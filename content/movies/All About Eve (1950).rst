All About Eve (1950)
====================

I only watched this one because it was said to be an inspiration
(ripped-off) for the underrated *`Showgirls`_*, and it certainly is. So
much of the story crept through (young and ambitious blood taking over
from the established; lawyers of the established getting involved; much
conniving involved in the process; etc). Luckily I did enjoy this one
throughout, which is quite a rare thing for a movie so old. But, the
movie is waaay `overrated`_. WTF!

**pros**

-  gorgeous gals: Marilyn Monroe playing a small part of a young gal
   trying to make it as an actor and Bette Davis playing the established
   actor
-  nice dialogue here and there

**cons**

-  shitty (unconvincing) performance by the gal playing the title
   character, Eve
-  another shitty performance by the gal who introduces Eve to the
   established
-  stagey direction, as is common with movies this old; and we are
   supposed to take these characters seriously?
