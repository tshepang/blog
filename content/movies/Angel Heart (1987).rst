Angel Heart (1987)
==================

There's at least moment where Mickey Rourke shines, where he bullies an
old medical doctor into providing some info. Robert De Niro is
impressive, that is until we tire of his spurious appearance. The black
gal is intensely gorgeous, but I don't know what's up with the romp...
maybe it was for the audience. Otherwise the movie is not very
interesting and the twist is shitty-ass.
