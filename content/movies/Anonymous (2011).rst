I praised the costume and production design when the movie began, but
not later on. I either stopped caring, or the excellence wasn't
sustained somehow, I just don't know. I was also impressed by the 2
ladies who portrayed Queen Elizabeth I. The conspiracy story wasn't so
riveting since I've heard it before (and I don't care much since I think
Shakespeare is overrated, either that or I'm not smart/cultured enough
to enjoy his work). The movie is however very well-made, and non of it
bores at all, even though it loses steam part-way through.
