A couple is going through a period of immense pain in their life,
triggered by the death of their toddler. A lot of the imagery is horrid
and bizarre (e.g. there's an animal walking around with a stillborn
still attached to pussy), and the movie itself is rather dreamlike, with
the director exercising high levels of freedom.

The twist near the end is quite shocking; the love the man has for the
woman (who is mentally screwed by the loss) is impressive.
This woman is given is really good performance.
The dialog is quite good as well.
The title is misleading, and is based on `a removed concept`_
that was in an earlier script.
