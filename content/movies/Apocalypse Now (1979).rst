Apocalypse Now (1979)
=====================

The first hour is nothing short of masterful. I'm referring here to
goosebumps that only result from supreme artistic excellence. I am
referring more specifically to the movie's first battle, the merciless
attack led by Robert Duvall. Not only is it amazing to watch, but Robert
Duvall's performance is mesmerising. His character's eccentricity
(insane bravery and obsession with surfing) is unforgettable. It's one
indication of the director's love for being over-the-top, and it works
quite well, in the first hour.

Marlon Brando has very powerful moments dedicated to his character, a
twisted fuck who revels in intense horror resulting from his experiences
of war. He doesn't appear in much of the movie, and is filmed with
reverance of a prophet, reminding of the old man in the early scenes of
`Seven Samurai`_. Dennis Hopper does a wonderful turn as his admirer, in
one of the few performances of his that are actually enjoyable (and I
honestly can't remember which other ones are).

Despite this, I am not going to neglect to mention some questionable
casting choices:

-  Martin Sheen is not bad, but there must have been someone more
   suitable. Nice voice though, especially when he narrates.
-  The driver of the boat sucks, and he sucked in *Malcolm X* too.
-  I'm not sure about Laurence Fishburne; he seems too artificial, like
   some sorry attempt to keep the story interesting.
-  Harorissio Ford looks like ineffective comic relief, without being
   one.

Although the quality of being over-the-top worked well in the first
hour, that was not exactly the case elsewhere. For one, the Playboy
antic was acceptable. But as if that wasn't enough, they (later on, for
some silly and unjustified reason) also had to fuck the travelling men.
There was also the moment at a dinner table with the French. Note that
these moments were very well done, but they just don't live up to what
the first hour promises. They almost seem like desperate attempts at
keeping the whole thing exciting. Yes, and that wasn't enough still, so
there had to be sex and romance too, oh and the gal rocks so hard, and
her face and sensuality of the magnificent Tilda Swinton.

The shortcomings of the movie aren't comfortable with me, for I would be
happy to name it a masterpiece. But it's not. Excellent as it is. The
simply there so much mor eout there that's overall suprior. Surely this
is a work of visual excellence, and is showered with amazing
cinematography and, especially, production design. The only war movie
that is any match on both these elements is *Saving Private Ryan*. Maybe
that's a careless statement, but my memory is hardly ever impressive.
