More a showcase of animation technology than a satisfying story for a
feature-length movie, it\'s a prequel to the [two][] [movies]. It\'s got
some good things going for it:

-   The lips of the little girl are amazing
-   The environments have wonderful detail
-   The cyborg lover of the lead character of the previous movies,
    Briario, is a lot more pleasing to watch

This time around, there is no noticeable 2D/3D fusion, which helped made
me notice how sucky we still at at doing convincing human faces, unless
you have a massive budget I suppose. The movie doesn\'t represent any
noticeable advancement of animation capabilities, even though it has its
moments. As regards the story, it\'s interesting enough, but really has
nothing new. The giant robot thing is just stupid, and the leading lady,
who is not as a major a character as she was in the first movie, still
has unexplained physical prowess. She also too damn lucky, brushing off
highly dangerous situations like they are nothing. Sad.
