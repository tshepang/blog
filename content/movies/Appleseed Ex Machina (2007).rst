Appleseed Ex Machina (2007)
===========================

The lead character from `the first movie`_ takes a backseat somewhat,
making way for the cyborg friend and former lover, and to a lesser
extent, the lover's clone, as well as to multiple other key characters.
It's an interesting concept actually, and actually one I haven't seen
explored before: that the clone looks and acts so much like the former
lover presents a challenge, and the conflict is apparent, but not
overdone.

The director, who also directed the first movie, has worsened his
obsession with beautiful people. There's a lot more of them here,
although I did really like a senior representative of some weapons
manufacturing company named Poseidon. She's presented with greater
admiration than the lead. I find that strange, especially because of the
fact that the lead was given such angelic treatment `previously`_.

The action does not offer any real improvement over the previous movie,
even though the budget is 3 times as large. It's also not as
interesting. The animation is of more consistent quality the first
movie, but there's nothing really groundbreaking.

**sidenote**: Why the fuck did they have to drastically change the
physical look of Athena (basically the president of the city) so much?
She's not even recognizable.
