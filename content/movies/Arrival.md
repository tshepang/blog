Never have I seen the idea of aliens portrayed with such realism. The
attempts at communication is exhilarating, the kind that *Contact*
(1997) gave when I first watched it. Sadly, like that earlier movie, the
movie focuses way too much on the lead\... I would have preferred more
attention given to the event. The worst of it is an ability that\'s
revealed towards the movie\'s end. It really takes away from the joy the
movie was. Why do they have to fuck with wonderful movies! Anyways, I
loved the beautiful imagery of the alien writing system, but they could
have made it look less than spheres on fire\... at first, I thought they
trying to say that they need a new home due to fucked home planet.
