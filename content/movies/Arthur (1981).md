[The world\'s critics] amaze me again, with their love for this
uninteresting and (mostly) unfunny comedy. Someone even nominated it for
its script. WTF! [The sequel] is a lot better.

There is some appeal to the lead performer, but he\'s mostly just
annoying. None of the other performances are particularly good, except
of course [the guy playing the caregiver], who never fucks up anyways.
