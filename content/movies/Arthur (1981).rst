`The world's critics`_ amaze me again, with their love for this
uninteresting and (mostly) unfunny comedy. Someone even nominated it for
its script. WTF! `The sequel`_ is a lot better.

There is some appeal to the lead performer, but he's mostly just
annoying. None of the other performances are particularly good, except
of course `the guy playing the caregiver`_, who never fucks up anyways.
