There's touching moments:

-  the mother expressing her greatfulness
-  the two great compliments the mother gets

There's funny moments:

-  the emitted sound when answering the phone
-  some of unusual behavior the author portrays

The movie also boasts some unusual dialog, and an unusual (and
irritating) character played by Cuba Gooding, jnr.
