Asterix and the Vikings (2006)
==============================

I always found the characters of Asterix & Obelix series fascinating.
Most interesting was the kindly Obelix, the overweight warrior who
happens to be the toughest of them all. The voice talent he's given here
is pretty good.

In this rather quirky movie, the more interesting character is Abba, the
daughter of the Viking king. She isn't an originial creation, but her
sass, her tough-gal attitude, and her front-teeth gap makes her fun to
watch. I also liked the dumb son of the villain. There's good humor
sprinkled all the place.
