Superb performance by all 3 people playing the writer girl, my favorite
being the youngest, which happens to be among the best child
performances I've ever seen. One other nice performance is the young
girl who eventually gets raped. I like the rather lame use of
type-writer sounds during certain sequences; I also like the expansive
sets showing bombed (World War II) areas as well as the military camp
(that wasn't cheap). Otherwise the main story (a man gets
falsely-accused of rape) is boring and often full of sentimentality, and
I enjoyed none of the other performances.
