Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002)
==================================

The least interesting of the three movies in the series, complete with a
badly miscast Beyonce Knowles (even worse than Elizabeth Hurley in `the
first one`_). This is made even worse by her failed tough 70's black gal
persona, a bad parody of Foxy Brown. The most annoying, and
worst-developed, character however is the guy named Goldmember. What
were they thinking? Luckily, Fat Bustard is interesting this time
around, and so is the son of Dr. Evil.
