==================================================

There is a good humor here and there, some of which is unique. Check for
example the opening scene, and every musical and photo sequence. Trouble
is that some of the jokes just miss the spot, while the hilarity of some
totally disappears on a revisit.

One low point of the movie is the miscast Elizabeth Hurley, whose
persona (or acting ability) simply does not fit.
