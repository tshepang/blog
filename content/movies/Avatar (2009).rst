good
----

-  the best thing in the movie is the tribal humanoid creatures; they
   are given solid and believable personalities, as if they exist
   somewhere; the best work is the leading lady, who also happens to be
   damn fucking' desirable; I also loved the female spiritual leader
   (she got presence); the decision to make these creatures a different
   size to humans is, since the makers chose to avoid the laziness of
   nearly everyone else making humanoids similarly-sized to humans
   (what's the chances?);

-  the entire experience of those humanoids riding flying creatures is
   pure movie magic; the creatures they ride are highly are quite
   impressive (check for example when our hero is to tame one for the
   first time)

-  the concept of Avatars is quite unique and fresh

bad
---

-  human characters were not given quality treatment, all but the lead
   (the image of him and his wheelchair is iconic); most unconvincing is
   the military leader, followed by the corporate representative

-  the general feel of the alien world feels too artificial (there's too
   many bright-colored plants and animals); the creature design is not
   satisfactory; it's a failed attempt at impressing is with beauty

-  the helicopter driver lady should have been excluded; she is just not
   an intersting actor, and cheapens the movie further

what others feel
----------------

-  I liked this `short analysis`_ of the movie.
-  One commenter `correctly noted`_ stylistic similarities to the
   much-deplored Jar Jar Binks of Star Trek fame.
-  I also enjoyed a `disapproving review`_ by a famous inventor and
   futurist, Ray Kurzweil.
