Baise-moi (2000)
================

A low-key French-language and less cartoonish answer to *Natural Born
Killers*. It also has affecting and believable performances and a
horrific, painful, and powerful story which also feels as random and
undirected as its two leads.

The best performance is that of `Raffaëla Anderson`_ as the more
trigger-happy of the 2 girls. It is sad that she has not done anything
else of significance, beyond porn.

The one complaint I have is that the switch between 'sad girls' to
'killer girls' is not really explained, and rather sudden.
