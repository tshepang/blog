Bamboozled (2000)
=================

I last watched *Bamboozled* perhaps a decade ago, and I'm glad to say
that it seems even better than the first viewing, bar the intensity of
the climax (some things work better the first time). Spike Lee's
direction is amazing (rough and unpolished, just like `Baise-moi`_).
This is the best acting role I've seen by the not-too-talented Damon
Wayans as the lead character, Jada Pinkett is sweet to the eye as his
*help*, Mos Def is real fun as a shit-for-brains gangster, but the
movie's only really good peformance is that of Michael Rapaport, who
plays the TV executive. Shit, this niggah is (nearly) worth the entire
movie itself, and is so **real**.
