Batman Begins (2005)
====================

It is sad that this turned out a lot less impressive on a revisit,
though it remains better than any of the Batman movies before it. The
lead actor is not interesting; the mini-villain, the old man running the
underworld, is a bit interesting, though a bit too self-conscious, and
therefore not believable.
