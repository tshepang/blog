Battle In Heaven (2005)
=======================

Never in my movie-watching history have I seen a character as dull as
the lead character here. The only one that comes close is that of
`Crimson Gold`_. It also happens to be the most bizarre movie I have
seen this year. It explores sex in a way I have not seen before, in that
we get to see very unattractive characters (husband and wife) take part
in it. The way they are short is also very suggestive, like the movie is
some sort of soft porn, only with superior direction, and a non-sense
story.

The movie is also a more extreme form of a `Romance`_, in that it was
probably inspired by it, both in terms of explicit sexual shots and very
slow and pro-longed takes.

The only characters that seem alive are the young gal (fucking gorgeous)
and her friends.
