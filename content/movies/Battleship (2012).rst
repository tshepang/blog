Real nice visual effects, some of the best I've seen yet:

-  the wheel-of-destruction and the destruction it wields make for some
   of the most impressive character designs ever; the design isn't so
   fresh... it's inspired by some similar machinery in one of the
   *Transformers* movies

-  it's not groundbreaking, but the facial rendering of the aliens is
   amazing; it's not at the level of a Davey Jones or a Kong though

The movie isn't as big and loud as the *Transformers* movie series, but
the concept is a lot less silly, and the story a lot less annoying. The
dreamy concept of military of various countries actually working
together in a very close fashion in peacetime.

The most surprising thing about the movie is the appearance of the
leg-less guy, some ugly big guy who gives a wonderful performance, the
most interesting in the movie. It's surprising because I've never seen
the guy before, and that a crippled character would be given such a key
role. Sure there was `Dr. Strangelove`_, but that was a comedy.

It was sad when the movie ended, both because it was too short, and
because there was no explanation on what the aliens wanted. What made
this even sadders is fact that they appeared not wholly evil, so that
made them interesting. I even thought that, later in the movie, there
would be something like *stop fighting us; we come in peace*.
