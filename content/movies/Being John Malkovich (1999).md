[Another great dark comedy], this is a superbly fresh and entertaining
exploration into what would it be like to experience being another human
being. It also got wonderful performances:

-   probably the only John Cusack performance I\'ve enjoyed yet
-   Catherine Keener is amazing, and so is the gorgeous Cameron Diaz
-   John Malkovich rocks playing himself
-   my favorite is the movie\'s funniest character, the employer John
    Cusack\'s loser; it\'s pure pleasure watching his eccentricities

The movie could do with better camerawork and visual effects, maybe even
set design, but one can almost ignore those shortcomings since it\'s
well-written and directed.
