Being John Malkovich (1999)
===========================

`Another great dark comedy`_, this is a superbly fresh and entertaining
exploration into what would it be like to experience being another human
being. It also got wonderful performances:

-  probably the only John Cusack performance I've enjoyed yet
-  Catherine Keener is amazing, and so is the gorgeous Cameron Diaz
-  John Malkovich rocks playing himself
-  my favorite is the movie's funniest character, the employer John
   Cusack's loser; it's pure pleasure watching his eccentricities

The movie could do with better camerawork and visual effects, maybe even
set design, but one can almost ignore those shortcomings since it's
well-written and directed.
