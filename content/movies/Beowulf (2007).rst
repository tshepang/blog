Beowulf (2007)
==============

I enjoyed this old-fashioned and take on fantasy heroism a lot more
first time I watched it, though I did find it pointless, and still do.
Even the lead villain isn't as seductive. The animation could be better,
but the worst of it was the human faces. They should have made it
live-action, or better still, not made it at all. Or it just needed a
better writer. Some of the imagery was worthy of notice, especially the
water-on-skin effects. It was not ground-breaking though, at least to an
untrained eye like mine.
