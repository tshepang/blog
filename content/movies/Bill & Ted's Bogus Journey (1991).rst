=================================

I expected this sequel to be junk, but was pleasantly surprised to find
it was about as exciting as the first, and perhaps funnier, and with
richer content.

**pros**

-  The Grim Reaper was great fun to watch; one of the highlights was him
   challenging the duo, who were playing for their freedom from hell.
-  It was fun to watch the evil Bill & Ted.

**cons**

-  The novelty of freshness went away.
-  Keanu Reeves still sucks.
-  The genius scientist could have been more fun, and their melding
   seemed to serve no purpose.
-  I miss the splattering of comic one-liners that the original had.
