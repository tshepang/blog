=======================================

I haven't seen this one probably in over ten years, and I remember
enjoying excellently well, much like now. Of course it's a popcorn,
laid-back comedy, but it's amazingly entertaining.

**pros**

-  The few heavy-duty words found on many of the movie's lines adds to
   great comic effect.
-  A truly fun performance by the guy playing Bill.
-  The effort that went into designing the worlds of the historical
   characters, their constumes, and their character design is
   impressive, especially for a movie of this nature.

**cons**

-  Keany Reeves was as bad as he is today. Damn, what a let-down.
-  Well, the visual effects should not count, since the movie is like
   ancient
-  An extremely shallow story/plot.
-  The honorable Abraham Lincoln should have been given something to
   say.
