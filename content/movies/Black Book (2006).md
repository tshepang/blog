Although there\'s some interesting-enough stuff going on, helped much by
a quality performance by an immeasurably gorgeous leading lady, it just
feels like\... there isn\'t anything remarkable.

**sidenotes**:

-   Jonathan Rosenbaum has an [interesting comparison] to [Schindler\'s
    List], citing *Black Book* to be morally more complex, and therefore
    less escapist.
-   The mention of the movie [Mata Hari] inspired me to watch it.
