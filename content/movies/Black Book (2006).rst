Black Book (2006)
=================

Although there's some interesting-enough stuff going on, helped much by
a quality performance by an immeasurably gorgeous leading lady, it just
feels like... there isn't anything remarkable.

**sidenotes**:

-  Jonathan Rosenbaum has an `interesting comparison`_ to
   `Schindler's List`_, citing *Black Book* to be morally more complex,
   and therefore less escapist.
-  The mention of the movie `Mata Hari`_ inspired me to watch it.
