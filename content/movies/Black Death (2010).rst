Black Death (2010)
==================

A very grim portrayal of a witch hunt motivated by an epidemic in some
ancient European area. It's well-made and well-acted, and the battles
are more convincing than the more expensive movies set in its time, and
violence more brutal. There's not one light-hearted moment, no comic
sidekick, just a whole lot of shit life. Lucky me being born here and
now.
