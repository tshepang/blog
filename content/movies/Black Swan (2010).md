Excessively depressing and disturbing (all the blood and physical harm;
the annoying personality of the lead character; her possessive mom).
Also, like [Showgirls] and [All About Eve] before it, it\'s main theme
is of a fresh stage performer hungry to be at the top, and the harms
resulting from that obsession. At the end, Darren Aronofsky is revealed
to be the director. Not that I would have guessed it, but it wasn\'t
surprising, given the director\'s other movies, *Pi* and [Requiem for A
Dream], which could hardly be called easy viewing. It\'s very well-made,
but I seriously didn\'t enjoy it.
