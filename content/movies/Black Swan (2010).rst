Black Swan (2010)
=================

Excessively depressing and disturbing (all the blood and physical harm;
the annoying personality of the lead character; her possessive mom).
Also, like `Showgirls`_ and `All About Eve`_ before it, it's main theme
is of a fresh stage performer hungry to be at the top, and the harms
resulting from that obsession. At the end, Darren Aronofsky is revealed
to be the director. Not that I would have guessed it, but it wasn't
surprising, given the director's other movies, *Pi* and `Requiem for A
Dream`_, which could hardly be called easy viewing. It's very well-made,
but I seriously didn't enjoy it.
