==============================

Some of the imagery is beautiful, and so is the lead character; the
scene in the car with father and daughter is surprisingly good, and does
not fit the movie; that daughter is given the movie's best performance;
the ends feels rushed... laziness; the demons are among some of the
worst creature designs ever in movies... there must have been a problem
with the budget.
