Bob The Butler (2005)
=====================

It's a recycled story of a guy who appears to be a loser, but happens to
be quite useful when put in some specific and unique situation. I
appreciate it because, regardless of being formulaic and shallow, it
feels fresh -- it has unusual, laid-back direction, and quality comic
performances from the lead and, most especially, the master butler. It
screws up with it's needless use of slapstick.
