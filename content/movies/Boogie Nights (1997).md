I watched this several years ago and do not remember being impressed. I
just now revisited it to ensure I didn\'t miss anything. Well, it\'s not
much. The character of the lead is curious, with its great innocence and
kindness, until over halfway through the movie when he displays
jealousy. It\'s not a good performance, but more a half-comic one. The
more interesting one is that by Julianne Moore, who is more desirable
here than elsewhere (if memory serves well).

The violence feels forced. Also, some extended sequences, e.g. the
shitty fire-cracker scene, help make the movie overly long, at over 150
minutes. The whole exercise feels pointless, and [is way overrated].
