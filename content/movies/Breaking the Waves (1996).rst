Breaking the Waves (1996)
=========================

All performances are of good quality, best of which is the best friend
of the protagonist, who also happens to be a nurse. The movie is
otherwise unbearably boring, and me wonders why people punish themselves
by constructing such painful movies, especially ones so pointless. The
experience is made even worse by the ridiculous length of around 150
minutes.
