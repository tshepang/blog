Brewster's Millions (1985)
==========================

A very delightful and shallow comedy about a guy who is to spend
millions within a month for an even bigger reward. Richard Pryor, the
lead, is fun to watch and so is the story, especially early on. The best
act in the movie is the lead's political campaign. I can vaguely
remember it, so I consider among the funniest movies I've watched this
year.

[**sidenote**] Richard Pryor style of comedy makes Chris Rock look
like a sorry imitator.
