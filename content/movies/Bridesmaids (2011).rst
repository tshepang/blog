Bridesmaids (2011)
==================

My memory sucks but this is the best chick flick I've seen yet. Although
some of the humor is recycled, it doesn't feel so. Much of it is quite
good and original. There are good performances from the lead and the
lady getting married. The traffic cop isn't bad either, but the movie's
most interesting character is the masculine lady. I haven't quite
experienced a tomboy character done this way. There's the suckiness that
is so common with romantic comedies (the fallout between best friends),
and worse, merely brushed away.

On another note, it's interesting the kind of effort that goes into
mindless things like wedding ceremonies.
