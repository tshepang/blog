Buffalo Soldiers (2001)
=======================

My initial review:

    It's surprising that a movie as radical as Buffalo Soldiers could be
    destributed at all since it's about the most effective anti-war
    movie I've seen in a long time. It's filled with fresh acting,
    though the movie's villain doesn't really convince while the lead
    character could have been portrayed by a better actor (Phoenix isn't
    interesting at all).

A revisit was not so great, including the radicalness I felt, the
freshness of the acting (what was I thinking?), nor the anti-war
sentiment strong at all. I even went as far awarding it best story of
movies I watched first time in 2008, which is something a little
puzzling now. Instead, it just feels pointless and arbitrary.
