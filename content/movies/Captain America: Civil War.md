I really, really love the new character, Black Panther, as well as the
performance. The suit is amazing and so is the fighting style. He easily
is the most interesting character in the movie. I do wish that his
background was given more attention though (how did he learn to fight so
well, and how did he manage to own a suit that amazing).

Runner-up is Winter Soldier, who was also the most interesting character
of the previous movie in the series, [Captain America: Winter Soldier].

The 3-person fight near the end was something special, though its
motivation was not very believable. It was rather dark for the movie,
and steers too far from what we\'ve come to learn about the characters.

Like so many big action movies, the movies suffers from over-complexity
of the plot and action sequences, making it harder to follow and
appreciate. It doesn\'t help that it had a ridiculous number of
characters, including 2 surprise additions. Having colorful characters
can be exciting, but they simply were not needed for the story.
