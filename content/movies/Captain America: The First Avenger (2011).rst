Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
=========================================

Some of its moments are so bad that they are hard to bear. There's some
uninteresting acting too, e.g. the frail Captain America and the love
interest. None of the other performances are really good, and the
villain is embarassingly bad, as if from some low-budget sci-fi movie.
The script is bad and it's strange that the movie comes from the same
studio as *Iron Man*. There's isn't even decent visual effects to lessen
the pain. Luckily, the final-form Captain America hero is fun to watch.
