Cars 2 (2011)
=============

I was not a big fan of the original, but this one is even worse. It also
happens to be an excuse to give more screen time to the rusty car that I
suppose was a big hit in the first movie. There was some decent humor
but nothing fresh. Some of the visual are pretty good, but
inconsistently so, as if it was hastily put together... "we gotta go
make millions quick".
