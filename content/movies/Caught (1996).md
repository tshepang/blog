I fell in love with this one years ago when I watched it first time, and
a revisit didn\'t disappoint at all. The characters are very
well-developed and it\'s easy to fall in love with them. This most
especially applies to Edward James Olmos, who gives a wonderful
performance as a stubborn fisherman husband. His son is excessively
annoying, and his wife excessively desirable.

What\'s extra kool about the movie is that the cheaters aren\'t
portrayed like villains, but rather, victims of lust. At the same time,
it\'s still not portrayed as an okay thing to do, but the 2nd-last scene
was a little too much.

Of all movies that cover the subject of infidelity, this is probably the
best.
