Caught (1996)
=============

I fell in love with this one years ago when I watched it first time, and
a revisit didn't disappoint at all. The characters are very
well-developed and it's easy to fall in love with them. This most
especially applies to Edward James Olmos, who gives a wonderful
performance as a stubborn fisherman husband. His son is excessively
annoying, and his excessively gorgeous wife, no wonder the homeless guy
couldn't resist her.

What's extra kool about the movie is that the cheaters aren't portrayed
like villains, but rather, victims of lust. At the same time, it's still
not portrayed as an okay thing to do, but the 2nd-last scene was a
little too much.

Of all movies that cover the subject of infidelity, this is probably the
best.
