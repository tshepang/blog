Change of Plans (2011)
======================

Brooke White, the lead female performer, scores quite high on the
desirability charts; the music her character does sucks sadly. The movie
feels fresh (it's not your typical pro-family fare), but not the "family
about to break apart" moment near the end, which is just too common.
Worse is that it's annoying and feels contrived (and a better actor
should have been in the place of the government lady). The attitude the
older girl shows is also just too common, but it's a decent performance.
