**pros**

-  wife is oh-so-gorgeous
-  quality performances by the wife and the husband; each was a pleasure
   to watch
-  my shitty memory says that this is the best couple quarrel in my
   movie history; oh, and her abuse was rather intense, and unbearably
   so; it was so horrid that when hubby retaliated physically, it felt
   like justice (and this is from someone who can't bear the thought of
   male-hit-woman acts)
-  edgy like fuck, and without abusing it

**cons**

-  kids are unconvincing, especially their leaders, the so-called
   prophets
-  how the fuck can an 8-year-old throw a knife so well, so far?
-  unexplained story; all of that, and for what, exactly?
