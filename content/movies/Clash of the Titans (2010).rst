Clash of the Titans (2010)
==========================

I like a few of the characters:

-  Medusa: gorgeous, yet scary
-  The Kraken: among the largest of all movie monsters I've seen,
   complete with superb facial design
-  The underworld creature that drives the boat, together with the two
   others pulling the ship
-  Hades: the entrance — when spreading his 'wings' — is entrancing and
   the performance (Ralph Fiennes) and body movement befitting; this the
   movie's best moment

There were also some badly-designed ones:

-  The scorpions aren't convincing, nor are the battles involving them
-  The charred-skin wizards have some presence, but what the fuck is up
   with look
-  The former king who got burned by Zeus' lightning got make-up that
   looks like something from a B-movie; that character is not
   interesting too

As for the story, it is merely standard. Nothing to celebrate there.
Strangely, I enjoyed the movie more on a revisit.
