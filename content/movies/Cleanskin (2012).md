This would have been excellent had it not dwelled so much on the
terrorist guy. I did find his appearance refreshing at first (a fresh
and beautiful face, and a solid performance), but he\'s simply not lead
character material. This is unlike the Sean Bean character, who gives a
very fitting character and performance.

The first several moments are entrancing, and compete favorably in terms
of execution (and grit) against far more expensive productions like
those in the [Bourne series].

The one weak spot in the movie is the beheader character. He was
supposed to be menacing and heartless, but he looks more fit for a
lesser movie, and the moment involving the baby was simply needless.
Luckily there is no shortage of superb acting, most notably from the
lady in charge, [Charlotte Rampling].
