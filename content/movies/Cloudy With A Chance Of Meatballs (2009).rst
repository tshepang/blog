Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs (2009)
========================================

It starts off amazingly well, with the same level of movie magic offered
by gems like *The Incredibles* and `Megamind`_, but is funnier by far.
Sadly, halfway through, things start being not so okay. That's when we
get the ever-uninteresting, slow-the-movie-down morality talk, which
includes the beloved hero getting a little too cocky. There's also some
annoying moments where the town inhabitants treat this hero unfairly,
like the moment where they attempt to attack him when something goes
wrong with his food-making machine. It's fine when they are shallow and
stupid, but it annoys me a little when the writers makes them that
`unappreciative`_. One other not-too-kool thing is when these writers
push the boundaries of fantasy a little too far when the former town
icon wears a body of a chicken, and suddenly possessing supreme martial
arts skills. Really now! Oh, the mayor was just too annoying, given some
villainy that's left unexplained.

Okay, back to the good stuff:

-  The character design is amazing and so is the animation.
-  The lead characters is recycled, but still exciting enough.
-  The concept is great, and exploited well enough (even though it runs
   out of steam about halfway during the movie's running length).
-  The food design is great. It reminds me of *Ratatouille*, and even
   rivals it. The most amazing of them all is the ice cream.
