Collateral (2004)
=================

Tom Cruise plays one of my most favorite hitmen and in fitting
performance (his shortcomings aren't so obvious) while Jamie Foxx
embarasses, especially later when more (he's supposed to express great
distress and rebellion) is demanded from his boring performance.
Everyone else does very well, and the casting is excellent, as is the
direction, and the dialogue. The whole is very unpredictable and the
seemingly random nature of the story and the style of the camerawork
(the same used in the 2006 *Miami Vice*) gives the movie a certail level
of realism. It's magnificent.
