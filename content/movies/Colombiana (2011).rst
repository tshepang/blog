For almost it's entire running length, it's very fast-paced, a fact that
helps hide its incompetence, considering that there's nothing new or
fresh, other than having the first young girl action hero I've seen yet.
Hers portrayal is not convincing, even when grown up. However, there's a
good performance by the guy playing the lead FBI agent (`Lennie
James`_), who recently impressed me in `The Next Three Days`_. The
subplot involving the love interest was a waste of time, although it was
well-made, as is the movie in general.
