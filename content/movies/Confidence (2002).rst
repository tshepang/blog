Confidence (2002)
=================

There's too much of an attempt at doing kool, much like *Lucky Number
Slevin* (which was made some years later), only with a lower budget and
less flash (production design, cinematography). It's however a lot more
satisfying. I loved John Carrol Lynch's performance. Morris Chestnut, a
not-so-competent actor, is miscast, and so is Dustin Hoffman, who
appears to be trying too hard.
