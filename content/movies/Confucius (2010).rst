================

An embarassing lead performance by Chow Yun Fat; with the help of
unimpressive direction and script, it showcases silly ancient Chinese
traditions, as if they were somehow virtuous. Oh, and I still wondered
what's so great the title character did for the world, other than at
times using his influence to try exert kindness to his world. I would
have preferred some time spent on explaining how he actually gained that
influence... and I'm not visiting his Wikipedia article.
