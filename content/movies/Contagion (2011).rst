Contagion (2011)
================

Very well-made, rather convincing/realistic (the fresh dialog
contributes well to that), well-acted movie (Laurence Fishburne is a joy
to watch). One favorite scene is when husband (Matt Damon) is told of
passing away of wife while in hospital. The reaction is quite sad, and
perhaps represents the best such scene I've ever seen.

The movie is quite gloomy, and makes me impatient when we are actually
going to finally manage to be fully immune to disease
(nanomedicine/genetics).

[**sidenote**] A `superb review`_ whose one criticism (disrespect for
blogging) was on point.
