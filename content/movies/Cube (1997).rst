It may be a B-movie, but it does get intriguing at times, with quality
bits of dialog here and there. My favorite moment is when the smart gal
explains to the cop the complexity of the calculation he tries to force
her to perform. Solid piece of performance there.

The worst thing about the movie is the unexplained transformation into
villainy by one of the characters. Feels silly and desperate, as if the
writers were concerned the whole premise is not exciting enough, which
it is.
