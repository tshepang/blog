A rather disappointing, and possibly last, sequel of the series. I
suspect, when the writers set out to explore the intrigue in the
preceding movies (more [the first], since [the second] was just a
needless rehash), they did not actually have a solid idea how to explain
it\... the actual purpose of the Cube. It is sad. Surely one could setup
brainstorming sessions about these things, especially if you are going
to spend a few million?

Well, the execution in this case is not disgusting bad, and there is
okay acting, but the fascination is largely gone, and the excuse of an
explanation is merely a passing reference to patriotism and religion.
Also, the villain is not very impressive, despite a desperate attempt to
portray an eccentric evil character. It\'s a far less successful attempt
than the a character he reminds me of: the genius scientist in [Afro
Samurai: Resurrection].
