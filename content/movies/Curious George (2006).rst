Curious George (2006)
=====================

The uninteresting first scene, that of the playful title character
having fun, made me not want to proceed to the rest, but the ultra-sweet
female love interest and the eye she had for the museum tour guide led
me on. It isn't much, and has some unbearable and formulaic happenings
(e.g. the evil son of the museum owner, the break-up between the tour
guide, and the got-to-get-the-monkey-back shit). I managed to muster a
smile here and there as well.
