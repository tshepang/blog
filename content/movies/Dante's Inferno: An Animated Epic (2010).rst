Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic (2010)
========================================

An entertaining fantasy about some heroic warrior fighting demons in
hell in order to reach his loves. It's moderately well-made and has some
interesting animation (check when Satan forcibly pulls that lover
towards self), but the storyline skimps through the details, and feels
shallow... it feels incomplete.
