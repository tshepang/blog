Dark City (1998)
================

Innovative story concept, excellent elements (direction, cinematography,
production design), ultra-desirable gal (Jennifer Connelly),
impressive make-up (The Strangers), and an interesting eccentric character
played by Kiefer Sutherland. The Strangers are given good performances,
most especially the one leading the search.

Despite all the goodness, the experience is marred by some shortcuts
taken by the writers (maybe a result of laziness, or pressure),
some continuity errors here and there, an uninteresting lead,
and some bad visual effects, most evidently in the laughable final showdown.
