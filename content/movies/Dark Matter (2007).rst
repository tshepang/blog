Dark Matter (2007)
==================

The story is quite original: our hero is a boy genius and the villain is
a professor he assists, who proves to be a hypocrite averse to being
challenged.

What is Meryl Streep doing here by the way? I mean her character? She
does add sweetness to the otherwise dull movie though.
