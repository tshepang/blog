Dark Shadows (2012)
===================

I found this surprisingly laid-back, and more humorous than other Tim
Burton movies. The greatest pleasure offered is the villain, perhaps the
most interesting witch in movie history. Her cracked-skin nature is also
something fresh (me have not seen such before), her sexuality amazing,
her passive and quick-acting personality welcome (check for example how
she does not waste time to get to meet her old lover), and her beauty so
incredible that she can easily be forgiven for her great cruelty. I
enjoyed the sex scene a lot, which was another surprise.
