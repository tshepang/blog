Das Experiment (2001)
=====================

Lacking the intensity of its `remake`_ and its lead character not as
heroic (and even annoying), I was left unsatisfied. For its remake, the
injustices begin very early during the movie (perhaps within 30
minutes), while for this one, they begins only in the last 30 minutes.
They however go way too far to be believable (e.g. attempted rape). The
romance is beautiful (did you see that gal!), but they just had to push
it as far as the gal having a part in the violence.
