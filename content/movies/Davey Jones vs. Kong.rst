Davey Jones vs. Kong
====================

:date: 2007-04-11



The star of *King Kong*, which I saw in late 2005, was easily the
greatest of all CGI characters ever. But then I proceeded on watching
*Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* in early 2006, whose Davey
Jones was so unbelievably real that I couldn't choose between the two. I
checked web yesterday to see what others thought and it was roughly
split between the 2, some also mentioning Gollum to be the winner. Davey
Jones and Kong far exceed the overrated Gollum of *Lord of Rings*
trilogy according to me, and the two happen to be a tie, even though the
Kong lovers defend him due to his greater interaction with the
environment. If I was however asked to choose a personal favorite, it
would have to be Davey Jones, whose piercing eyes and screen presence is
unbeatable.

On a related note, I was surprised to find that many viewers found Davey
so real that they thought it was (incredible) make-up work. The same
happened to me regarding the first installment of the trilogy, *The
Curse of the Black Pearl*) for what I thought was superb make-up work
was actually CGI â€” the transformed and skeletal pirates.
