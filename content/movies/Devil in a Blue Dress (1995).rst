============================

This was a lot more enjoyable when I first watched it several years ago,
though I remember nothing else of the experience, other than the
performance of Don Cheadle. It is the one movie that made me respect him
acting skills, though he never again repeated a performance this good
(in my experience). The rest of the story is mildly entertaining and the
movie did not age well.
