District 9 (2009)

The documentary style has been employed elsewhere but there's nothing
quite like *District 9* in all movie history. Its weird and wonderful
story starts off with nice comic touches and transitions into a
harrowing tale of human torture, and ends as some action-adventure of
sorts, complete with superb visual effects, with some nice creature
ideas. Sure there's warts here and there, but to have a gem like this
emerge from my country of residence, South Africa, is quite something.
It is the best movie based there. The lead performance also deserves
applaud.
