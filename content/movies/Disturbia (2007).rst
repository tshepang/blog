This is probably going to be year's worst movie. It displeases so too
much that it's hard to write anything about it. It is so ridiculous that
it would have been salvaged by having the twist being that the guy was
just hallucinating all the time, especially since it was hinted that
house arrest makes people go crazy. Fuck, what's up with the supposedly
hot gal? What the hell was the respectable Carrie-Anne Moss doing here?
No glitzy acting offers any more?
