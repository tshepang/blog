Django Unchained (2012)
=======================

Lots of humor, delicious acting, brutality (the suffering of the slaves
is way too intense), and heroism. Also, I don't remember watching a
Western with a black hero (untapped territory), and with a director as
good as Tarantino, it must have been... wait for the lame...
a walk in the park.

The movie has the rare quality if being entertaining throughout,
a feat more impressive given the movie's running length of over 150 minutes.
Tarantino also decided to go a bit lazy on us
(as he did with the *Kill Bill* movies)
by sprinkling fantasy over his script,
where for example we find the heroic Django highly-skilled with a gun,
without even a mention of training.
Another example is the number of men the DiCaprio character has at his command,
an excuse to spill liters of blood, as well as showcase the Django excellence,
If only the lead was a better (or more interesting) actor than Jamie Foxx.

My favorite (and best) scene is one where the great Tarantino appears.
I find it the best directed of all,
even though there are more showy and complex ones.
My favorite performance there is the oldest of the white guys.
I also enjoyed watching the guys in the cage,
not to mention Tarantino himself (good actor this guy).
