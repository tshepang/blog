I kept waiting for an explanation of why the couple kept their kids
isolated from the world beyond the family. I was even more curious why
the father, a very unpleasant character, went to the trouble of
supplying the son with regular pussy. None of that is explained, sadly
(unless I missed it). This father character annoyed me most about the
violent lashing at this regular pussy at some point (I find such
arrogance unbearable). The earlier lashing was not as saddening since
the girl, the most rebellious of the three kids, happens to be an
asshole.

The movie is well-made, and got unusual dialog, and a weird story. The
acting is all good as well, and so is character development.
