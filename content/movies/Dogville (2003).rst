Dogville (2003)

It's hard to imagine the movie having as much impact had it been told in
a more conventional way (there entire thing is done on a small stage,
which doesn't change throughout it's entire 3-hour run, except at the
very end). It's an effective experiment that proves that, with good
directorial skill, a movie experience can be satisfying with almost no
budget. I however expect that only serious movie buffs would watch the
entire thing.

My first viewing of this was among the most impactful I've had of any
movie, to a point where I called a masterpiece. A revisit wasn't so kind
though because of diminished impact. I still love the narrator's style
of storytelling (told like a children's fable). I found the character of
the philosopher quite annoying (and I'm sure that was the intention), a
character developed and performed similar to that of the scientist in
Battlestar Galactica tv series (the one made in the 2000's). There is
not one other character that is interesting, that is if we ignore James
Caan. The movie is also frustratingly long and I'm curious why it was
made (why portray such brutality), and even more curious, why was the
annoying philosopher character added.
