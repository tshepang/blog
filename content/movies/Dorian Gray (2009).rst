Dorian Gray (2009)
==================

This is a movie adaption of a `novel`_ that had a rather interesting
concept: a painting is made of a pretty man, and instead of him getting
injured or aging, it's the image of the painting that does. It's fun
watching the title character's deeds, though he sometimes does it at the
expense of the innocent. The negative influence his 'mentor' has on him
is annoying, and worse still, the 'mentor' complains when his fuckin'
daughter falls for Dorian - hypocrisy.
