Possessing some of the best works of cinematography and production
design ever, the movie also boasts some of the most intense dialogues
I\'ve seen yet, and an amazing performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman
as a Catholic priest. His enemy is one of the most relentless characters
in movie history, played by a miscast Meryl Streep. Her lack of fear for
confrontation and her quick-to-act attitude are admirable, but her
brutality is rather unreasonable.
