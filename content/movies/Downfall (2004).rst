I don't recall ever seeing such extreme loyalty and devotion to a living
figure as the people surrounding Adolf Hitler in this grim portrayal of
his final hours. It goes beyond irrational, and into insane territory.

Excellent movie by the way (acting, direction, writing). The portrayal
of Hitler's moments of outrage are classic (one of which has been
`parodied numerous times`_).
