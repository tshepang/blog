Dracula (1992)
==============

An unbearably-uninteresting and badly-made take on the legend of Dracula
(Gary Oldman), the world's first vampire. It's rather shocking that it
was made by the great Francis Ford Coppola, and it's probably his worst.
A better (character development; acting) vampire can be found in
`*Nosferatu*`_ (1979). Winona Ryder is quite bad as the vampire's lover,
though not as much as Keanu Reeves (who also has a face so gorgeous).

The concept of the vampire's shadow, which defies physics, is rather
interesting.
