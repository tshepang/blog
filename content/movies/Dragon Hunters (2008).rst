Dragon Hunters (2008)
=====================

The character design is quite impressive, all but the purple dog and the
monsters. The oversized warrior is an admirable character, due to his
great (and naive) kindness, and of course, his looks (design). The
movie's best design is however the servant of the gal's father, even
though it's the kind seen before (that of villainous characters).

The world of the movie is unlike I've seen before, a world with weird
gravitational behavior, with pieces of ground constantly breaking from
the land and floating in the air. It's a dark story that, sadly, feels
too short.
