Dredd (2012)
============

Not really a remake, nor even an alternative take, but more like 'based
in the same universe'. Far smaller than `the 1995 movie`_, and a lot
less ambitious (and a lot better, which was not a feat at all). Much
lower budget, and visibly so, as well as poorer visual design. Could do
with a better director/producer combo. But, the story is actually pretty
decent, and the suspense well-executed. The movie could do with a better
cast. The guy with the eyes does give a decent performance though, even
though he has too much of a Frodo character in LOTR (i.e. not fresh).
Also, the psychic lady is at least as pretty as she could act. The
villain, on the other hand, is not so convincing.

I should be grateful that I didn't get to see lead actor's untalented
face, though I was exposed to the embarassing mimicry of the Sylvester
angry mouth.
