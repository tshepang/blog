Eat Pray Love (2010)
====================

I found this one really unbearable and boring. There is decent acting,
but Julia Roberts is extremely uninteresting as a leading lady (I've
never enjoyed any of her performances). The story makes me curious if
the writers believe in the shit they are promoting (prayer; fortune
telling). On the bright side, the experiences in Italy were kinda fun,
and I felt longing for the warmth of the relationships created there.
