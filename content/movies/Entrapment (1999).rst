=================

Not very interesting, even with the ultra-gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones.
I didn't get a chance to watch it all these years, even though I had
mild attraction due to my previous love for the featured item, the
Petronas Towers. The amount of money to be stolen by the lead characters
is ludicrous and is suitable only for comedies, or at least it should
have been more convincing.
