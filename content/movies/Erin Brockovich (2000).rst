Erin Brockovich (2000)
======================

An okay and interesting enough movie about this heroic lady (Julia
Roberts) who plays a key role in a law-suit against a major corporation.
I saw it some years back, and it's just forgettable. I don't like the
fact that the story about the ex-husbands was so ignored, or even the
character of the angelic boyfriend. They just didn't care to justify why
he was so kind, or even cover a little bit of his backgrounds.

Julia Roberts' performance got a lot of praise, and although it's far
from bad, I find it overrated. There's nothing spectacular about it.
Maybe these people should just admit that they loved the character she
played. I did too. She is far tougher than I'll probably ever be.
