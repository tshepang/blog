Fair Game (2010)
================

Really sad when you happen to be an excellent and loyal worker, only to
get neglected by your seniors when unfairly attacked. It happened to one
CIA secret agent, and her hubby (Sean Pean) resorted to fight for the
truth (the US government knew there was no threat of nuclear weapons
from Irag), while she resorted to silence, for some reason (maybe fear).

Sean Penn is always good, and so is `Bruce McGill`_, the guy playing a
senior CIA director. The first scene, with the disrespectful guy (good
acting) at the table, was fun. The whole movie is also full of good
dialogue and direction.
