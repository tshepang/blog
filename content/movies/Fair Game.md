My favorite moment is in the beginning of the movie, where the lead
character meets one disrespectful guy. What makes it more fun is what
happens to him later on\... he though he was in control. The rest of the
movie is also enjoyable, and remains so even on a revisit. It\'s made
all the more fascinating by being based on actual events.
