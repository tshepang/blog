Given that this is a second rate actioner that isn't overall decent, I
was not going to write a review about it, except that I actually found
the twist quite unique. I am temped to say *surprising*, but that's what
twists are supposed to be. But this one is especially so.

The effort to make the professional assassin interesting worked pretty
well, considering it could have been a lot more cheesier/cheaper. The
girlfriend of that assassin is extra-lovely too, and gives a decent
performance.
