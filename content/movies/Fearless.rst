Fearless
========

:date: 2007-04-04



I was truly impressed by the showmanship showcased in *Fearless* which
stars Jet Li as the undefeated martial arts champion of some town in
China. This is mainly due to its martial arts choreography which ranks
as the best I've ever witnessed, and that's achieved by the greatest
such practitioner, Yuen Woo-Ping. Most notable is the battle between the
hero and the childhood adversary, a battle which has no equal in all
moviemaking, exceeding that of the previous title-holder in which a
jealous 'brother' challenged Jet Li's character, in *Fist of Legend*
(`update`_), another work of Woo-Ping's choreography.
