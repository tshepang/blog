It's a strange one because it feels so pointless by the end of it,
unless it's just another anti-prison movie, in which case it's pretty
much effective... the brutality is incredible. It's also the first time
I've ever seen Harrold Perrineau play villain, and he was not so
convincing. The movie itself is very well-made, and the acting decent.
