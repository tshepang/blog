Final Destination (2000)
========================

The initial scene, leading up to the point where wonderboy saves a few
lives, is handled very well, complete with good suspense. But it seems
that's where all the effort in the movie went, because the rest is just
average fare. The story is quite thin, so there was a lot of boring
fillers (and uninteresting acting) just so the thing can last ~100
minutes. The villain wasn't interesting either, though I remember
greater excitement on the first viewing.
