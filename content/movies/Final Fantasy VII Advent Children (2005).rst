Final Fantasy VII Advent Children (2005)
========================================

I was a lot more impressed the first time I saw this:

    The complexity and technical sophistication of the fight sequences
    are what *The Matrix* trilogy only dreamed of. It's the best piece
    of action I've seen so far.

After a revisit, I feel like that first statement is an exagerration,
even though the action really is good. Problem is that it's just too
frantic, such that it's hard to notice what the fuck is going on. With
that in mind, the second statement is no longer true.

I found the movie unbearable, and I find it strange that I was able to
bear it first time around. I found all the talk of life force or
somesuch silly, I found the characters uninteresting, I found the
obsession with children's innocence overdone, I found the obsession with
beautiful boys and girls needless, I found the character design (worst
of which was the monster flying creature) to be of intensely bad taste,
I found the choice of lighting shitty, I found the (seeming) requirement
to have familiarity with the games the movie is based in order to
appreciate the (complex) backstory stupid, ...
