Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within
=================================

The pacing is unbearably slow and the story simple not interesting.
Luckily, some of the sci-fi elements are done well, e.g. the material
the softens landing impact is interesting. The designs of suits and
other things, like the aircraft and the city are decent. The only
interesting character is Doctor Sid (voiced by Donald Sutherland). I
suspect more effort (and love) was put into him than anyone else, since
he's the most detailed (this is 3D animation) and convincing, while also
very interesting.
