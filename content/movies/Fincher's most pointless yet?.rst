Fincher's most pointless yet?
=============================

:date: 2009-07-17



David Fincher decided to go all *Forrest Gump* on us with *The Curious
Case of Benjamin Button*. Here's a `good review`_.

On a more positive note, Tilda Swinton is tremendously elegant and
provides a real accomplished appearance. Cate Blanchett is a pleasure to
watch as always as the main love interest, but nothing is as striking as
the visual effects done on Brad Pitt's twenty-something face.

--------------

**sidenote**: Interestingly I later found that both movies were written
by the same person.
