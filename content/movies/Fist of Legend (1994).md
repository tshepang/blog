I don\'t know how many times I saw this one as a kid, but I loved it
a-lot. I even went as far as proclaiming it to have the best martial
arts choreography of all movies. After this revisit, however, I am not
so sure anymore. I don\'t have a replacement in mind though. It remains
impressive of course, but feels dated. The shallowness of the story
doesn\'t help either\... some important issues (racism, prostitution,
xenophobia) are highlighted, but it doesn\'t look like the writers were
good enough to exploit them. They were pretty much glossed over, and the
romance was very unconvincing.
