A notable element from this movie is the performance of the lead by Ryan
Gosling, who is sort of like a hit from nowhere since I haven't seen him
before. Yet another notable element is the sophisticated and humorous
dialogue, though the script itself falls short near the end, incapable
of justifying various activities done by the villain. Fortunately there
wasn't any formulaic non-sense common in movies.

The story proved a bit sketchy and not so brilliant on second look,
while Rosamund Pike remains a goddess, while Anthony Hopkins pulls off a
great and effortless performance.
