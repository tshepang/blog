G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009)
==================================

Nice visual effects (check the suits) help rescue the shitty and
formulaic movie. The action is rather too loud, but the Paris chase
sequence deserves praise. I wish a better lead actor was chosen; I wish
there wasn't no past romantic connection with him and the lady; I wish
there wan't no past connection between the two best fighters: the
villainous one and the silent one. These are all badly-handled.
