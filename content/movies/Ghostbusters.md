It\'s nothing new, but it was fun watching [Kristen Wiig] oogle over
[Chris Hemsworth]. I also enjoyed the nerdy performance of [Neil Casey],
who plays the villain, and I wish he got more screen time. There is also
a brief performance by the ever-flawless [Charles Dance]. My most
favorite though is the super-fresh one of [Leslie Jones],
