God On Trial (2008)
===================

It's amazing that one can take a silly idea, and make a decent movie of
it. I'm not sure what the point was, but the some powerful moments, and
decent acting. My favorites were the physicist's turn in the court, but
better still was the rabbi, whose encyclopedic knowledge of the Old
Testament made his argument all the more moving. Stellan Skarsg√•rd, who
plays the judge, is as great as usual.
