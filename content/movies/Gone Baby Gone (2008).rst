Gone Baby Gone (2008)
=====================

Nearly a year later after the initial viewing, I am a bit puzzled why I
was impressed so much by this movie. It is surely a good movie, but I
went too far by praising its direction, acting and cast, or even drawing
parallels with `Se7en`_, a masterpiece.

One thing I got right though was the twist:

    The twist is silly, and just doesn't justify everything that
    happened before. It sucks when movie makers don't know how to end a
    perfectly good story. On a positive note, that's when the lead
    character (Casey Affleck) chooses to do a very noble act, making him
    truly admirable, especially considering what he sacrificed.

I was afraid a revisit would disappoint of course, especially because
this was the remaining newly-watched movie I labeled `excellent`_ in the
entire year... it was going to be the best movie of the year.
