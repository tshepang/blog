Good Will Hunting (1997)
========================

I love stories about genius, but this one is as depressing as fuck.
Also, it's `waaay overrated`_. The one character that tries make it
colorful is Minnie Driver's (the girlfriend), but like everyone else,
she isn't convincing. She was designed to be super-cool, but it looks
fake and cheap, like a character I would create.
