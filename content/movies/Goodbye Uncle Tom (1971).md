The most brutal slavery movie I\'ve seen yet, though peppered with humor
all over the place: it\'s a dark comedy/satire, which is a rather daring
approach considering the subject material. It\'s interesting to note the
cruelty Black people here face, which isn\'t better than that of farm
animals. Makes me feel guilty for eating meat, much like [Roger Ebert
makes me feel] for calling this movie good.

I wish more effort should have been made to make the blood more
convincing. The weirdness of the final scenes, those shot in modern
days, isn\'t welcome either. They are too eccentric and meaningless.
