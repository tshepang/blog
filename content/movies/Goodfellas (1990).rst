Goodfellas (1990)
=================

Heavily-overrated with not a single performance worthy of high praise.
Fairly-enjoyable, but my great lack of interest in the mafia doesn't
help. It's not hard-hitting enough (think *American Gangster*, which
itself however has the advantage of being younger), and the direction
not satisfactory, which is very strange considering it's done by Martin
Scorcese, the same guy who brought us both *Taxi Driver* and *Raging
Bull* before.
