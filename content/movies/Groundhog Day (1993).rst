Would be kinda nice to be caught in an eternal day. Imagine all the
stuff you can learn, and all the experiences you can have. All the risky
things you'd do, and all the impact you can have on people. That's what
the lead character does, and he goes as far as committing suicde a few
times, only to wake up the next day,, and the next day.

The movie is done okay, but could be better... more exciting. There's
some funny parts here and there, but well, the movie is merely okay.
