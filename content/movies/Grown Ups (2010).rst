================

There isn't much going for this one, except I admire one of the
characters (in his early forties) falling in love with an elderly lady.
The movie is not unbearable but it should be given a miss. Chris Rock
shows again his extreme lack of acting skill and Salma Hayek hasn't lost
her position as among the most beautiful women on the planet. That old
lady gives a nice performance BTW and she looks pretty for her age.
