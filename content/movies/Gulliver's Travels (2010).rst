=========================

To make up for its extreme shallowness, the movie is very exciting. I
liked the concept of supreme Civil and Mechanical engineering abilities
of the little people. I also enjoyed how the movie made fun of old,
formal-sounding English. The movie also happens to be a Jack Black
vehicle, and this guy has some real good humor. What else me liked is
the robot. Also, the water effects (the storm) are amazing.
