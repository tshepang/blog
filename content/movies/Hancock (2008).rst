Hancock (2008)
==============

I believe something got seriously fucked-up during the production of
*Hancock* because the pre-twist moments are amazingly fresh and original
and about everything afterwards is shitty:

-  unnecessary brawl that should have taken place elsewhere other than
   the city
-  underdeveloped explanation of super-ability
-  annoying plot-holes

It feels like someone came up with a good story and didn't know where to
run with it, and in those moments of panic, hashed up something that
will disappoint any viewer.

Luckily all casting is spot-on. Check...

-  the 1st corporate meeting
-  the PR guy and his wife
-  the inmates
-  the kids

Also some of the action (and visual effects) is pretty good (check the
train smash). This a really fresh kinda superhero and it makes one
salivate for (superior) sequels.

It was interesting to find that `so many critics agreed`_ that the move
started well and screwed up about halfway through.
