Harry Porter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)
==============================================

Not as enchanting as `the first one`_ but scarier with far bigger
effects, though none is spectacular, much of which is clumsy: the
spiders, the snake, and the angry tree. More tiring than the first since
it's more of the same thing. The new ugly slave-like character is
unbearably irritating. It is similar to the Smeagol/Gollum character in
the Lord of the Rings trilogy, only a lot less interesting.

The one character I enjoyed much is that of the owner of the flying car.
Check especially the moment he accidentally celebrates the tale of the
boys' adventures in the flying car. My previous favorite character from
the first movie does not compare, and is a lot less interesting this
time around.
