Harry Porter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)
============================================

Two things I enjoyed most:

-  the performance of the guy playing step-father of Harry Porter; it
   was however a recycled caricature
-  the chess game, which had great character design and animation; it's
   a pity it was mixed with substandard editing, with shots repeatedly
   cutting to the kids; also, the kids didn't fit well in a sequence so
   scary

Most anything else is just standard, which is the sort of thing that
made it mysterious to me why the book/movie series has such spectacular
success.
