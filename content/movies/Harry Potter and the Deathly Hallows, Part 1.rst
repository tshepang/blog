Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1

The story of the Deathly Hallows makes for some of the best animation
I've seen yet, though it runs for a few minutes. It's a fresh departure
from an otherwise dull and overlong experience. The movie is even a
worse experience than `the immediate predecessor`_.
