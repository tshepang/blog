Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2
============================================

Lots more action than `the previous movie`_, perhaps more than all the
others too, though not really an interesting conclusion. The main battle
feels like a poor copy of that in *Lord of the Rings: The Return of the
King*, though it's not bad at all.
