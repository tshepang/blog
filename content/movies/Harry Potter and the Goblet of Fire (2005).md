This one is no improvement on [the one immediately predeceding it] but
is darker still, perhaps with even greater effects, though not as
numerous. The creature design of the baby-sized arch-villain deserves
respect, though it\'s nothing new. The scenes in which it appears makes
for a darker movie than the previous ones.

The careless passiveness of the movie is quite annoying. One glaring
example is that Harry Potter\'s troubles with the dragon are given all
the attention, while those of his competitors are totally ignored.

One performance that I enjoyed a lot, a new character, is the super-tall
lady.
