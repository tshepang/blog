Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)
=============================================

Though bearable, this is the worst so far in the series. Too much of it
feels like filler material (the romance and ensuing jealousy for
example), and it feels like we were denied a proper climax... it feels
incomplete. Even the visual effects are lesser, both in number and
merit, from (at least) the previous two movies. One thing that deserves
praise though is the smoke/ink effect that was used whenever the
villains (dis)appear. It was also used to great effect in the
end-credits.
