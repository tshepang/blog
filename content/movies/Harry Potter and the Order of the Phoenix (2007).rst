The battle between arch-villain and Dumbledore is the best action piece
so far in this series. It's quite intense and has wonderful visual
effects. There are other good visual effect moments here and there.
Even the Dementors_, which I so admired in the `3rd movie`_,
have been given a facelift, though I prefer the original look.
