Another Tarantino copycat, perhaps the worst I've seen yet. Michael
Madsen sucks because he does the same performance he always gives (since
`*Reservoir Dogs*`_) and so does Dennis Hopper. The slow pacing is
nearly unbearable, and the smart-ass dialogue is just not as good as
Tarantino can make it. Interestingly, Tarantino lend his name to the
movie (*Tarantino presents...*). Seems like he's not easily embarassed.
