There is no shortage of hilarious moments, though none is as great as
the pregnancy one; Jamie Foxx does a nice bit performance; the character
of Kevin Spacey is rather overdone.

The movie is fun, but it sadly has a sketchy, amateurish feel of *The
40-Year-Old Virgin* or *Office Space*, both of which were also fun. It
just feels like a collection of antics, instead of one solid whole
worthy of being called a movie.
