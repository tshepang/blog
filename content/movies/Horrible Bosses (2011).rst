Horrible Bosses (2011)
======================

There is no shortage hilarious moments, though none is as great as the
pregnancy one; Jamie Foxx does a nice bit performance; the character of
Kevin Spacey is rather overdone.

The movie is fun, but it sadly has a sketchy and unprofessional feel of
*The 40-Year-Old Virgin* or a *Office Space*, both of which were also
fun. It just feels like a collection of antics, instead of one solid
whole worthy of being called a movie.
