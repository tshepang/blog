Hotel Transylvania (2012)
=========================

Nothing fresh here as I expected, judging by the trailer.
There is also that annoying and all-too-common thing of someone lying and
later regretting and apologising in public.
Movie is shallow too, and each character recycled.

I did like some of the dance sequences though (regardless of the
badness of the music), and I thought the dirty chef character was very
well-animated, and is a showcase of quality character design.
