I Love You Phillip Morris (2009)
================================

Too often if happens that a movie starts promisingly well, and in this
case, with solid direction and exciting acting, but later on lulls you
into boredom, forcing you to keep checking how long is left before the
end. It remains good throughout of course, but the (extremely)
unconcinving performance of Ewan McGregor does not help at all. I kept
waiting for 'his moment', but it never comes. There's also not a proper
explanation why the lead character, played by Jim Carrey, was so in love
with that Ewan one.

On a more positive note, Jim Carrey gives an amazing performance. I also
enjoyed that of the ex-wife.
