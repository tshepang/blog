Pretty much enjoyable, complete with an interesting lead and an even
more interesting creation in the form of a sweet oversized monster, Eva.
The character design is of good quality (check each of the mad
scientists for example), but the sad moment, that in which the lead
reveals lies he told, sucks as much as it normally does in, for example,
romantic comedies. This heavily taints an otherwise good fantasy.
