Pretty much enjoyable, complete with an interesting lead and an even
more interesting creation in the form of a sweet oversized monster, Eva.
The character design is of good quality (check each of the mad scientists
for example), but the sad moment, that in which the lead reveals lies he
told, sucks as much as it normally does in, for example, romantic
comedies. This heavily taints an otherwise good fantasy.
