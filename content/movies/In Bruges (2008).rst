In Bruges (2008)
================

Far better than the more expensive and colorful later work of this
talented director, `Seven Psychopaths`_. Great camerawork, enjoyable
acting (including even from Colin Farrel, which must be my most favorite
of his career), superb script (and dialog), a gorgeous and intensely
desirable gal, unusual storyline, and, and... what a gem?

There is a bit of a lull partway through it, but soon after, the fun
continues, and builds up to an intense and unpredictable last act, which
does not feel rushed at all... it's amazing. It's also helped a lot by
the superb Ralph Fiennes.

As in the above-mentioned movie, one can sense a work of a liberal
writer/director, where there is also some mention (and elevation) of
inter-racial relationships, and condemnation of a racist character. More
importantly, there is an important character in a form of a dwarf (real
nice performance there, reminiscent of that of the superb `Peter
Dinklage`_ in the excellent TV series, *Game of Thrones*), though,
ironically, he is the racist in question, but later apologises for it.
