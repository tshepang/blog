We here see a world where people stop physically aging when they reach
25 and have a year to live unless they get more (or less) time. Money is
replaced by time as currency, and the reason the setup is such is left
unexplained, though the hint given is population control. It also
appears as if the situation can\'t be changed.

This beautiful concept is fucked by a lazy plot and stupid casting
choices (the people were supposed to look 25). The best fun in the movie
can only be seen in the early scenes, but then the overly-courageous
acts and extra skills of the Justin Timberlake character were left
unexplained\... lazy writing. Luckily it\'s not boring, even to the end.
