The first scene is top-class, for the performance of the weary farmer
when forced to make an unpleasant choice, the sort where I feel
self-death is better. The best performance of the movie however is that
of Christoph Waltz, who plays the Nazi officer questioning him. Brad
Pitt is quite limited in terms of talent but not charisma, and is
provides the weakest performance of all key characters. Quentin
Tarantino is a weirdo who possesses the freedom (perhaps too much) to
paint whatever he pleases on screen, and luckily got the talent. He
gives this one superb suspense, exciting dialog, unusual (and
unpredictable) story, and wonderful editing. It\'s my favorite and best
of all his works, followed by *Reservoir Dogs*.

One interesting, and rare, thing is I enjoyed the movie a lot more on a
revisit.
