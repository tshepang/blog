Great martial arts choreography, some of the best I have seen; two
gorgeous guys, one the arrogant rural martial arts expert, and another,
the Janasese military leader, who is among the prettiest guys I've seen
ever.

There is nothing really new here, and the lead actor could be more
interesting. Sadly, each of these oriental martial arts actors have Jet
Li to match against, and that's a high standard of appeal. I am till
giving this one high marks because I seriously enjoyed it.
