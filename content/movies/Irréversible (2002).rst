Irr√©versible (2002)
===================

A skillfully-done experimental tragedy told backwards, having among the
most horrific scenes I've yet seen in any movie, and I'm not referring
to the rape scene, prolonged as it was (isn't it the longest rape scene
ever?). There's good acting and dialog, complete with high levels of
realism.
