It (1990)
=========

Horrible horror, and not much else going for it, except that the clown
is quite interesting, given his humorous and sinister character (and
laughter). Why they made the lady so sexually suggestive is strange. Oh,
and the black guy, why do I smell Black activism? The (non)battle with
the giant spider is ludicrous. It's hard to believe that movie makers
actually do watch their creations before release. They could have done
better with that spider, even in 1990. Oh, and the whole thing is just
left unexplained.
