It's a Wonderful Life (1946)
============================

It's sprinkled with some fun moments and interesting performances, but I
cannot forgive some of its shallow writing, especially the fantasy
moments near the end.

There's one especially gorgeous woman (the wife), and one especially
desirable one (the seductive near-lover). The lead has his moments,
though his character's self-importance is often annoying, and was
probably interesting to audiences of the time.

My favorite performace is by the lady playing Miss "could I have 1750?"
Davis, though it's a very small role, lasting just a few seconds. That
performance also feels out of place in the movie of this age. It feels a
lot more modern.
