I enjoyed the natural-looking performance of Tshepang Mohlomi, who plays
the leader of a gang of street kids. Also, his character is given some
depth: he appears an asshole on the sufrace, but is actually a nice guy
who, for example, allows his ass to get ripped apart, only to share the
rewards with the rest of the gang.

The display of chilhood innocence (and naiv√©ty) is done well, but sadly
none of the grown-ups are given any attention, all but the sister of the
dead mother, who gives the movie's best performance.
