The production design is top-class (impeccable set design and props),
while the old-age make-up is embarassingly bad. Even the 2 actors
playing the aging characters are unbearable to watch, perhaps as
unbearable as the immensely unpleasant character of J. Edgar Hoover. The
movie itself starts okay, but starts to be really boring and pointless.
I was surprised that it was made by the great Clint Eastwood. It must be
his worst.
