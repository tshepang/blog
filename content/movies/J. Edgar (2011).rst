J. Edgar (2011)

The production design is top-class (impeccable set design and props);
the old-age make-up is embarassingly bad. What the fuck happened there?
Even the 2 actors playing the aging characters are unbearable to watch,
Perhaps as unbearable as the immensely unpleasant character of J. Edgar
Hoover. The movie itself starts okay, but starts to be really boring and
pointless, and I was surprised that it was made by the great Clint
Eastwood. It must be his worst.
