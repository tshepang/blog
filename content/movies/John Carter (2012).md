Bizarre story (powerful beings screw around with affairs of entire
planets), and a hero with unexplained powers and flashbacks (unless I
missed the explanation). I do, however, appreciate superb character
design of the four-arm humanoids, even though their look and behavior is
similar to that of the giants of [Avatar].
