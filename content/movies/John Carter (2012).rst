John Carter (2012)
==================

Bizarre story (powerful beings screw around with affairs of entire planets),
and a hero with unexplained powers and flashbacks (unless I missed the
explanation).
I do, however, appreciate superb character design of the four-arm humanoids,
even though their look and behavior is similar to that of the giants of
`Avatar`_.
