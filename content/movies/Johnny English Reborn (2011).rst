Johnny English Reborn (2011)
============================

I enjoyed this a lot due to the delicious humor, best of which was the
out-of-control chair... absolutely hilarious. It was all nice, until
they had to do the stupid thing of bringing someone from the dead.
Instead of parodying the silly idea, they just fall prey to it. The end
is also lazy, and as uninteresting as the villain. Johnny's sidekick is
a strange choice for a movie character, while Rosamund Pike seems a
goddess. How could anyone look like that! WTF!
