Judge Dredd (1995)
==================

So someone spent close to $100m on this, and then classified it as ready
for release! One of the mysteries of movie-making. It is mildly
entertaining, but the visual effects are so bad (was it this bad in the
mid-90s?), the storyline so lacking, and characters so thin. I did
however like 2 character designs:

-  the oversized (and scary) robot
-  they guy with a metal head

For a far better take on the title character, see `Dredd`_.
