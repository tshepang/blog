Just Go With It (2011)
======================

It does not even try to be a good movie, but then again it is an Adam
Sandler comedy. There's some very hilarious moments, even though none of
them were original, except the ass-coconut moment.

One strange thing though is that I enjoyed Jennifer Aniston's
performance, and for the first time (if memory serves well). I also
enjoyed the performance by the girl playing her daughter. Girls of that
age are hardly ever funny (or no one writer really tries), but she was.
