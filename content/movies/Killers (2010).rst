I remember enjoying the movie a lot more first time, most especially
`Katherine Heigl`_. It is still enjoyable, but that Katherine, though
desirable, is just so irritating.

What else I felt last time I watched:

    The writers had no clue where to run with the story; I got surprised
    when it ended, because the attacks were simply unjustified, and
    there was no resolve.
