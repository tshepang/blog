On a third viewing, I still find the action impressive, but would not go
as far as *among the greatest*. The lead character tends to be annoying,
partly because he\'s used to legitimize lying (which is way too common
in movies), and partly due to the slapstick humor. He also survives way
too much physical pounding, and without a scratch. The movie is also
shallow.
