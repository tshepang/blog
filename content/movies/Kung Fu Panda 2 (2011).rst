Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011)
======================

I enjoyed this even more than the first time (which wasn't the case with
the first movie). The humor is great, and so is the action, and it's
overall better than the first movie, except that nothing beats the
escape sequence and the wobbly bridge fight. The villain is amazing, as
is his display of martial arts prowess. Sadly, the movie feels a bit too
short, and doesn't take itself seriously at all.
