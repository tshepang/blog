L.A. Confidential (1997)
========================

It has lost some of the intensity and edginess of the earlier viewings,
perhaps because there's been heavier stuff since, but it maintains its
excellence (direction, acting, script, production design). It got a
great cast, minus Kim Bassinger as top-class prostitute, and the gal
playing the raped character. The best performance is by Kevin Spacey
(smooth-talking cop), followed by James Cromwell (police chief).
