Last Man Standing (1996)
========================

Good stuntwork, especially the very first killing, even if it defies the
laws of physics. Should be forgiven because the movie is stylised. Bruce
Willis, the lead character, is interesting to watch in the beginning,
but we quickly get tired of him, especially because the whole thing
feels pointless, with him doing the same expressions, which don't lend
any reality to the fantasy. He should have a got a better hairdo too.
