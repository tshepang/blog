intial review
-------------

Owls aren't interesting animals at all, so I watched this in preparation
of moving on, but was captivated by the photo-realisitic rendering of
the birds' faces. I also enjoyed the humor offered by the two birds that
kidnapped the brothers, and that's one other thing that encouraged me to
watch the rest.

The movie runs for around 100 minutes, but it feels very epic. It lacks
the immediate and glossy excitement of a Disney/Pixar movie, and feels
more stately and serious, as well as darker. The characters are
well-developed and it doesn't feel like shortcuts were taken, well other
than that the repeat trips felt shortened, much like Timon and Pumba's
when they followed Simba back home. The battles are very well-made, and
the ocean waves, though brief, were quite impressive.

I did not experience any epicness second time around, nor did I notice
any outstanding character development. The eye candy was also not as
impressive. I also noticed annoying coincidences, as well as a far less
enjoyable experience.
