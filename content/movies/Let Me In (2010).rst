An exercise in embarassment. `The first novel-to-movie adaptation`_ was
released only 2-3 years before. I thought they wanted to offer something
else, maybe a budget, with some visual flair. But there's nothing. In
fact there is an uninteresting `Elias Koteas`_ as the investigator
(there was basically none in the earlier movie), and the companion of
the vampire (played by an extrememly uninteresting `Richard Jenkins`_,
who bored me horrendously in `*Eat Pray Love*`_). But these greedy
motherfuckas just wanted to exploit a good story, and give nothing in
return. In fact, the even got lazy, walking briskly over material that
was dealth with more depth in the first movie. But, I don't know the
details of the novel, so who knows, they might be more faithful than the
first movie. So I guess they just wanted to make an extra buck from an
audience that's too lazy to read subtiles.

While watching this, I kept wondering if would I give it more praise had
I not seen (or known) about the original movie. I'm not sure, because it
comes across as yet-another-horror movie, even though there's a gal
vampire. But that's not exactly a new concept (remember *Interview With
A Vampire*). It's not even remotely interesting. What's most puzzling,
beyond that the shit (it's not that smelly, I just hate it) got made is
the `positive response`_ it received from critics. WTF!
