Letters To Juliet (2010)
========================

Exquisite cinematography, (excessively) loving characters, and some of
the best depictions of Italian food and romance. The lead character
looks so damn nice at the wedding. The movie is overlong (it drags) and
has some unbearable romance. I like romance, but not when it's so
blatantly formulaic. Maybe if I was a stereotypical female, I'd melt.
