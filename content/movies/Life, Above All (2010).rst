Life, Above All (2010)
======================

There is much authenticity and freshness in the treament of poor South
African township experience, but there is also a lack of those since the
behaviour of some of the people is such that I've never witnessed (or
heard of, given the demographics of the setting) as a citizen of that
country... it's little too westernized, and annoyingly so too. Also, the
language was a little too pure to be believable for anyone familiar with
it. The story is mildly interesting and acting decent, my favorite being
the prostitute teenager.

The movie is more important than it's good, because it effectively
showcases the negative effects of denial and idiocy: "It's not HIV, I'm
just not feeling okay; maybe it's witchcraft; Friend, find me a good
traditional doctor; In the meanwhile, I'll try these herbal thingies".
