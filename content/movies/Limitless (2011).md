Possessing a great story concept, this movie centers around an
experimental drug that increases mental performance to beyond genius
level. The movie is filled with great visuals and there\'s a nice
performance by the guy playing the Russian money-lender. As for Robert
De Niro, I really wish a more interesting actor was given the role.
