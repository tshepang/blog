Possessing a great story concept, this movie centers around an
experimental drug that increases mental performance to beyond genius
level. The movie is filled with great visuals and there's a nice
performance by the guy playing the Russian money-lender. As for Robert
De Niro, I really wish a more interesting actor was given the role.

The movie cautiously steers clear of over-exploiting this exciting
concept. Perhaps the scope was limited by the budget, but luckily the
direction is really on-point. It's just that the whole thing could have
been even more fun.
