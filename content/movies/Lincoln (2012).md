Very well-made, with solid dialog. This dialog (and script) is also
unusual, an example being the opening scene which, though interesting,
felt like an attempt to be different. It did work for sure, since I
enjoyed it enough to think the movie was going to end up excellent.

The story focuses on the greatest accomplishment of Abraham Lincoln, a
man who I have, for a long time, greatly admired. One thing that\'s
strange is that this guy appears to be just one of the guys,
distinguishing himself only through his smarts when he speaks. It also
doesn\'t help that there is no visible security surrounding him to
indicate he is indeed the most powerful person in a country of millions.
