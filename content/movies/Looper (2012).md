I dislike the overly-loud banging sounds, which mostly emanate from the
gunshots. This is from a very violent movie which cast Bruce Willis (he
should retire), and [Joseph Gordon-Levitt], whose face should have been
left alone, especially since he does not resemble Bruce even a bit even
after all the non-sense is put on his face, digital or not.

I am hoping this overrated non-sense will be the last time travel movie
ever made, since the concept is utter crap (nonsensical). The story
starts exciting enough but loses steam very soon after. None of the
perfomers are solid, especially Jeff Daniels as villain.
