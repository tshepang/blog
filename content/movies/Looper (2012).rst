Looper (2012)
=============

I dislike the overly-loud banging sounds, which mostly emanate from the
gunshots. This is from a very violent movie which cast Bruce Willis (he
should retire), and `Joseph Gordon-Levitt`_, whose face should have been
left alone, especially since he does not resemble Bruce even a bit even
after all the non-sense is put on his face, digital or not.

I am hoping this overrated non-sense will be the last time travel movie
ever made, since the concept is utter crap (non-sensical). The story
starts exciting enough but loses steam very soon after. None of the
perfomers are solid, especially Jeff Daniels as villain.
