Lord of War (2005)
==================

Scathing, well-made satire; excellent and exciting during its first half,
and a slow-down in the second, with the usual consequences thing,
not to mention an annoying Jared Leto:
needless drama from the most beautiful man on the planet.
If only the movie kept the delicious pace,
and if only it kept the length at 100 minutes or so...

This is Eamonn Walker's best role, even though his performance didn't
excite me as much as it did first time around;
It was my most favorite from among `the movies I saw first time in 2006`__.
