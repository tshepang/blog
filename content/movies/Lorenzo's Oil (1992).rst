Lorenzo's Oil (1992)

Offers some insight in medical science processes, but there is at least
one concept that was dumbed down too much (Why volume of specific
compound rises when intake of food containing it is reduced?). I'm sure
it was for the lay audience, but I don't think the audience is that
stupid. Nick Nolte is annoying and unconvincing with the Italian accent
while Susan Sarandon's character is annoying with her obsession and
selfishness. Their perseverance is admirable though, as well as their
efforts to help discover the treatment for the disease their son suffers
from.

The balanced view of the scientific community vs. the parents is handled
quite well, and isn't as simplified as you'd come to expect in movies.
The scientists and those who respect them aren't viewed with
incompetence (let's ignore the dumbed-down part) or laziness, only with
the eye that they do have other priorities which are not necessarily
less urgent/important than the one faced by the parents.
