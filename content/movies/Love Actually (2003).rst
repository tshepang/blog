Love Actually (2003)
====================

There's a delightful/fresh feel to it and there's a bunch of fun
moments, but the whole thing is spoilt when it goes into typical
romantic comedy mode near the end, things like dozens of people
following a man who intends to propose, or a kid breaching airport
security to go mention his love for some gal. Bill Nighy and his manager
were fun to watch.
