Machete (2010)

Goog ole-fashioned action movie, with a deliberately sgallow storyline
and two beloved leading ladies, one (Jessica Alba) of which has never
performed this well anywhere (in my experience of course). The leading
guy, an ugly motherfucker who I only ever saw doing secondary roles, if
fun to watch. He does look like a tough guy. Steven Seagal is as scary
as always, and I wonder what the fuck Robert De Niro is doing here.
Aren't there more cerebral scripts for him out there?
