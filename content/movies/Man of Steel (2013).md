The visual design is amazing, and it made sense seeing that it was Zack
Snyder at the top, the same director who brought us the visual
masterpiece that is *300*. The movie has a weird feel to it, being such
a dark (and dull) re-imagining of the world\'s most recognizable comic
superhero. It has incredible visual effects, some of which represents
the most epic hand-to-hand combat sequences ever put on screen. The
Superman suit looks amazing!

The villain (Zod) performance is very fitting, and so is the lead
(Superman). I wish the reporter lady died at some point, or at least not
placed in situations so dangerous. Regardless, it\'s also a good
performance. I wish they had cast different people in place of Kevin
Costner and Russell Crowe.
