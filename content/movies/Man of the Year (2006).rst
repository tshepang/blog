Man of the Year (2006)

I was surprised that `critics disliked this one`_ for I enjoyed it much.
I found much of the humor great, and I found the performance of Robin
Williams wonderful. The romance however was not done very well, mainly
because the character of `Laura Linney`_, herself a very excellent
actress (remember `Kinsey`_), is very annoying.

Those critics mentioned dislike of mixing the whole thing with
conspiracy, and in hindsight, it was quite unwarranted. The movie would
have done fine without it, and it was just not done right, and Jeff
Goldblum performance didn't help either.
