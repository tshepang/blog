Marley and Me (2008)
====================

One thing of note is the care regarding the impressive performance of
that dog; the training involved must have been quite involved. It's
amazing. The movie's best moment, though, is the fast-paced scene in
which the lead character narrates a summary of his writings (he is
newspaper columnist). I thought it was quite innovative, complete with
fun content.

Beyond embracing pets, I thought the whole excercise was pointless. I
kept wondering, "Is this it? You sure this is all this movie is about?"
