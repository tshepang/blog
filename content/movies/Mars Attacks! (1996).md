The deception by the aliens on humans is one of the interesting things
about the movie, and the other being the flirting between the Pierce
Brosnan and the Sarah Jessica Parker characters. The latter is actually
quite charming, especially as a dog. Other interesting characters are
the forgetful lady and the disguised alien.

The movie is overall entertaining, but has just too much violence\...
the attacks are prolonged. The sub-plot about the former boxer is
horrible, complete with bad acting and uninteresting characters (boxer,
wife, kids) and looks like it\'s from some shitty B-movie. The whole
thing is also pointless.
