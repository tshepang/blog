================

This looks good for a movie so old. I expected some creaky stuff, due to
rotten film stock. Anyways, the title character, a spy, is extremely
uninteresting and is given a very unconvincing performance by Greta
Garbo. Similarly unconvincing and even caricatured is the general she
chills with, and worse still, her soon-to-be-lover.
