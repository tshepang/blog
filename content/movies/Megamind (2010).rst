===============

These 5 movies offered some of the best first-time viewing experiences I
ever had:

-  *Monsters, Inc.* (2001)
-  *The Incredibles* (2004)
-  *Robots* (2005)
-  *Ratatouille* (2007)
-  *Wall-E* (2008)

What do they all have in common:

-  wonderful character design and development
-  enchanting
-  a great/exciting story concept

The latest entrant on this list is *Megamind*, a thoroughly satisfying
movie, which has the traditional hero/villain thing, with a twist. The
character of the hero is simply amazing, for its deliberate
stereotypical design and development. The movie also has great costume
design. The title character is great fun to watch.

Anyways, one other characteristic of this list of movies is that the
appeal went down on a revisit, a very worrying trend, and that was the
case with *Megamind*, though it wasn't so devastating for it remains
excellent.
