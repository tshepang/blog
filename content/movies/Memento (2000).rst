A very solid story with superb, but disturbing, direction. The concept
is among the best I have seen. The acting is top class, notablet notably
the three leads: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano, in a
role that seems written especially for him. The twist sucks a bit
unfortunately, especially given that the lead appears to be a reasoble
character.
