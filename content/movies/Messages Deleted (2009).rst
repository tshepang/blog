I enjoyed all the performances, and this was helped by me being a fan of
Deborah Kara Unger (always a pleasure this god-damn desirable gal,
though she's aging). The lead was nice as well, and his gal gorgeous
beyond words. The story is quite thin, and feels incomplete, but it's
real weird that the movie didn't get much attention at all.
