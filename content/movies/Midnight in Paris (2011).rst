Midnight in Paris (2011)
========================

I watched this only because Woody Allen made it, and now I wish he was
the one playing the lead character, not a poor imitator. The fantasy
element of it is a bit interesting (no one in my experience has made
such a smooth and unassuming time travel movie) but there's a feel of
self-importance about the whole thing and that's annoying and makes it
unbearable. Maybe Woody is getting lazy and arrogant. I haven't seen all
of his work, but this is likely his worst. The costumes are nice though.
