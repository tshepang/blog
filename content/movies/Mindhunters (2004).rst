Mindhunters (2004)
==================

A bit disturbing with a gripping storyline. LL Cool J is an interesting
actor and so is the guy (in an interesting twist) who turns out to be
the villain. The setting (a simualtion of a small town, complete with
dolls/statues for humans) is quite spooky, but the whole thing isn't
satisfactorily justified, and the villain is too capable to convince (he
got too many things right in a very short period of time).
