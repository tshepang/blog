A very effective alternative to sleeping pills, but filled with curious
works of art, and some interestingly bizarre character designs. It is
pretty much pointless, but it was sort of interesting to watch the
super-cute gal go about her dreamy adventures. Of the creatures, none
was as annoying as the human-cat hybrids, none as scary as the bird-ape
hybrids, and none as original as the floating giants. I cannot remember
creatures as saddening as these giants. They alone make the entire movie
worth watching.
