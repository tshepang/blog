The movie may be great to look at (look at that house), and Ella Purnell
insanely desirable (she was an adult at the time, I checked), but I
loved the Hollows the most, the invisible monsters that takes the eyes
of Peculiar people.

That bit about eyes is, now thinking about it, rather stupid actually.
It was not even justified in the movie\... the writers just jumped to
it, all for the sake of dark.
