The wife character, played by Sissy Spacek, is not only
superbly-developed, but also desirable as fuck. Not only that, but it's
a wonderful performance. The father character is however given the
movie's best character development, as well as its best performance. One
other great performance is that of the bubbly guy from the US military.

The director offers an exhilarating and well-written investigative
thriller, much like his earlier `Z (1969)`_, a more intense work, though
lesser overall. The subject matter is grim and the imagery horrific. The
filmstock is of shitty quality sadly, perhaps a deliberate decision, to
help make viewers feel unease.
