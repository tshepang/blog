I liked the concept of the device that creates an optical illusion; I
also liked watching the Burj Khalifa, my favorite building, on which
some of the (noisy) action takes place. Not much else is interesting,
least of which is performance of the leading lady, [Paula Patton]. I did
however fall for the ultra-desirable [Léa Seydoux].
