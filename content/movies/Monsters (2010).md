Although directing/editing style is not new, it still feels fresh. The
visual effects are also done well, but the aftermath of the damage done
by both the title characters and the military is done even better. One
thing that\'s impressive about the whole production is that it\'s very
expansive for a budget of less than \$1 million. You would not even
notice. Sadly, there is a point where the lead characters are tiring,
such that I\'d appreciate if at least one of them got killed at some
point. They are also too damn lucky.
