Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979)
===================================

Poking a lotta fun at some the blind adherance and factionalism that is
all too common in society, and doing it in a very humorous way. This is
brilliant humor by the way. The effort of making the costumes and the
environment feel authentic is impressive. The only real annoyance is the
character of Brian's mom.

Luckily, unlike `Holy Grail`_, it doesn't feel too much like a
collection of gags.
