Mulholland Drive (2001)
=======================

A deliberately weird movie which is somewhat enjoyable, with some good
humor, though some of it is realy silly, perhaps for the sake of being
bizarre. It's nature also makes it hard to rate... I can't call it bad
because there's good directorial skill (I was captivated, even if just a
little).
