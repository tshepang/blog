Here's what I wrote over 3 years ago:

    Even with superb-handling and wonderful acting, it lacks intrigue
    (bar the memorable scene where the femme fatale gets uncomfortable
    treatment), so I'm only left with great cinematography and excellent
    sound.

I'd like to take away the "it lacks intrigue" part. It's more accurate
to say it's not intriguing enough. That's because it was fun watching
the planning, buying info, and even the executions themselves. Also, I
choose just two performances as outstanding (Geoffrey Rush and Daniel
Craig); Eric Bana (playing the lead character) isn't interesting enough
to be alone on screen. The movie gets dull after that femme fatale
incident due to the slower pacing. As realistic as the story feels, the
info salesmen were rather romanticised. I found the aging leader, papa,
a mere caricature. Not fresh.
