My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002)
===============================

An okay and shallow romantic comedy; there's some bad make-up for the
lead character in her early scenes; none of the acting is any good and
the male romantic lead is especially bad, as if he's embarassed or
something; it's interesting watching warm human relationships like the
Greeks in the movie have.
