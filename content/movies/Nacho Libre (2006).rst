Nacho Libre (2006)
==================

This is some oddball comedy, with highly-skilled direction, comic
acting, production design and camerawork. It has nice parodies of common
movie elements, but it gets tiring once it's clear that the writers
don't have any story tell actually; it's fun initially, but it doesn't
go anywhere as it 'progresses'.
