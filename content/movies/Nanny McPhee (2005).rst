I found this one hard to bear. If I saw it first, I would likely not
have given it's `far superior sequel`_ a chance. It's strange that they
were written by one person, because it's full of formulaic family
values, and stuff that is so stupid it makes me cringe. Even Emma
Thompson sucks. The only enjoyable character is the caricatured cook.
