Nanny McPhee And The Big Bang (2010)
====================================

I just found out that this is a sequel. It's a feel-good fantasy, made
for kids, with some decent moral lessons. Well, there's also some shit
about "it's okay to determine reality with your bones" bullshit. Not
good. Emma Thompson is always great to watch, even when under heavy
make-up. The encounter between the two boys and the father who is a
senior in the military was quite powerful.

**sidenotes**:

-  Had it not been for the misleading title (I thought it had something
   to do with the 'beginning' of the universe), I would not have
   bothered.
-  I hate `the original`_.
