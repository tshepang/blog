A revisit, as usual, didn\'t impress as much. I still appreciate the
humor and satire, but the fact that it made me feel asleep is not a good
thing. I didn\'t even enjoy the two performances I so praised above. I
don\'t even remember who I was referring to by *one voice of sane
reason*, and the latter movie I mentioned is a lesser movie overall. One
thing I still celebrate though is that very last scene\... the meeting.
