With tremendous suspense, superb performances, great cinematography as
well as immersive production design, is easily the Coen Brother's best
ever. The movie's best scene is when the Josh Brolin character explores
the scene of the murdered gangsters; the atmospherics are crying of
perfection, and so is the execution of it all. Another thing of note is
the Coen's love for the American South characterisations (remember the
touching *Raising Arizona*), and this is among the best such treatments
(e.g. check the guy who helps jumpstart the villain's vehicle).

Kelly McDonald is a favorite here and not forgetting Brolin. And though
Tommy Lee Jones does a decent performance, I could have been happier
with someone else (he's not a great favorite), and his role didn't need
a superstar he is. The unflinchingly evil villain is fearsome, made
worse by his calm demeanor.
