I once declared this one a masterpiece, perhaps due to the superb
direction, and the weird and wonderful storyline. Those remain
appealing, but a revisit wasn't so favorable.

There's nice performances all over the show (Laura Dern, Elias Kotes,
Helena Bonham Carter, Kevin Bacon, and all supporting characters).
