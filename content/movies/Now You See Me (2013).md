A ridiculous plot twist (I do not mind being fooled, but this is going
too far), some smart-ass characters (I don\'t mind such, but this also
goes too far, or maybe they are just not well-written), and an
uninteresting back-story stop this one from being more than a cheap
fantasy-thriller. Luckily it\'s very entertaining, and got decent
performances, not to mention an extra-desirable police lady. My favorite
performance is the lady who gets hypnotized in an early scene. She\'s
incredible.
