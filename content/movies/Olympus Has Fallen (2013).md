This is unique in that movies showing The White House being attacked are
very rare. I can only remember one in fact, *Independence Day*. I also
saw this concept explored only once elsewhere\... one of the seasons of
*24* (a favorite of mine). The amount of violence is quite unexpected,
and very sudden, though it could have went even further (e.g. killing
son of president). The overall movie, however, feels\... inadequate. It
lacks interesting performances, and the acts of the villains are left
pretty much unexplained. The pro-American stance, \"we will emerge
victorious no matter what\", is intensely annoying, though not to the
levels of *Independence Day*.
