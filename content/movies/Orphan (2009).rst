**good**

-  Amazing camerawork.
-  Vera Farmica is immensely beloved (as usual).
-  Her two kids are amazing, especially the daughter.
-  The title character is quite good too, a superb child performance.
-  `CCH Pounder`_ as the lead nun; haven't seen her in quite a while, so
   this is sort of a nice comeback

**bad**

-  As often happens, especially with mystery-thrillers, the allure
   doesn't last beyond the setup. It's tiring and repetitive, and the
   motives of the villain are unconvincing. The running length should
   also have been reduced.
