Pan's Labyrinth
===============

It's unfortunate that the ugly creature and it's environment, which
tends to be showcased in posters for the movie, is a rare occasion
within that same movie. Such misleading non-sense is annoying actually,
especially because it, together with rave reviews, made this among my
most anticipated movies. Otherwise I can't understand why the movie was
made at all, the message I mean.

**sidenote**: The celebrated scene is the only worthy thing about the
entire thing.
