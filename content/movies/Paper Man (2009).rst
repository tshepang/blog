================

Too much in here is unbrearably irritating (the two imaginary
characters, the asshole boyfriend, the slapstick) and uninteresting. The
movie is a horrible experience, though that was eased by the warm
moments between the lead and the stupid (allowing self to be treated
like trash by irritating boyfriend) gal.
