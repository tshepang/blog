**good**:

Quite an original story with a spectacular opening sequence, and a touch
here and there of wonderful shots (e.g. check the part where the lead
drinks water greedily, the day after his first experience).

There is wonderful casting too, even though I\'ll have to excuse the
lead and the villain. I most especially appreciate the role of the
middle-aged lead of the team, played by [John de Lancie]. He was a
pleasure to watch. There was also another nice, but tiny, performance by
the guy playing the fiance\'s father. There\'s great characters, like
the massive black guy, as well as the trailer-trash fat guy. The dialog
is quite good too, and the make-up is even better.

**bad**:

The story is quite silly, and rather pointless. The lead transforms
(participates in the game) way too quick to convince. There is also too
much (raunchy) sex, most of which is needless. The great jealousy the
villains portray is unconvincing, and so is their bullying. Also, the
ending feels rushed, as if there wasn\'t much material to work with.
