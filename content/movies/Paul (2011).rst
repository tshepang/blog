There's good humor to be had in here, but I expected more. The two
idiotic scifi lovers who help rescue the alien are played by the guys
who appeared in *Shaun of the Dead*, and they are fun to watch, most
especially the short one (he looks like an old woman). The alien they
are rescuing, the title character, is not interesting.
