This is a weird one, with a silly title, and nice visual effects, and a
desirable gal in the form of the title character's love interest. The
script is really stupid (e.g. one woman withstands the abuses of a
smelly man in order to keep her son safe, since the smell can hide the
son's scent!) and the end empty like a mothafucka. They just sit there,
without dialog? So, so strange that you spend millions on technical
wizardry, but neglect to spend enough time developing the story.
