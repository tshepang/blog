Another example of `The Case of 'The Matrix Reloaded'`_, this is how I
felt after the first viewing:

    ... happens to possess much sophistication (direction and dialogue)
    with some shocking imagery, including one which must have inspired
    Fight Club (a sort of obscenity which is surprising for a 60's
    movie). The movie also feels fresh, feeling like a modern
    psychological drama/thriller, and therefore not as tiring and
    awkward as those of its age, perhaps testimony of its director,
    Ingmar Bergman, who is among the most honored ever.

Watching it again, it's so strange that it feels like a different movie
altogether. I struggled to stay awake... it's boring as fuck. It's also
pointless. I must go find out what the fuss is all about.
