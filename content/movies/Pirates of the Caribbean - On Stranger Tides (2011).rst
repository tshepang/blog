Pirates of the Caribbean - On Stranger Tides (2011)
===================================================

Far less spectacular and less annoying (there's no Keira Knighley or
Orlando Bloom) than the earlier movies, it does have nice humor,
gorgeous mermaids (wonderfully portrayed), and a totally enjoyable
performance by the fat guy who has Jack Sparrow brought in for
questioning, if we exclude the silly moment... the two-thumbs-up.
