Pirates of the Caribbean 3
==========================

:date: 2007-05-23



A friend asked me of my experience of this spectacle and I could only
say that, albeit having many good elements, it was underwhelming â€” a
nice summary actually.

The best thing in the entire trilogy was Davy Jones (as I have pointed
out `before`_), and he was so perfect in his first appearance that he
couldn't be improved, and there is no new character introduced here that
is so appealing, nor any wow-factor element at all, denying the movie
any entry in the [visual effects spectacle][pointed] and movie of the
year lists. Sure the centerpiece of the movie raises bars, but I'm no
particular fan of sea-based action, so this ain't no visual effects
spectacle, but it's a satisfactory spectacle nonetheless, for there's a
smile on my face when thinking of it, and thinking of its complexities
and various treats (and especially the opening scene which is a landmark
in film history) [`update: 03 Mar 2008`_].

I mentioned the complexities, possibly a deliberate attempt by movie
makers to have viewers give the movie a second look, for there's so much
plot, so many betrayals, so many surprises, some disappointments (an
annoying marriage; Chow Yun-Fat's appearance), amazing make-up and
costume work (nothing new in the trilogy though), proliferation of
colorful characters (too many, even for a movie so lengthy)...

Pretty decent entertainment after all, but then I already saw
`Apocalypto`_, `Fearless`_ [`update`_], and `300`_ so far this year,
which still stand to be beaten, though none have visual effects matching
this pirates movie, and I doubt there will be this year
[`update <http://tshepang.net/transformers-2007>`__], which will
result in this being a reluctant winner in that department.
