Planet Terror (2007)
====================

Robert Rodriguez is a strange director. He is a good director, but he
tends to deliberately screw up his movies with some non-sensical events.
He did this previously with *From Dusk till Dawn*, where he would create
a quality setup, and then mess it all up lots of ugly creatures. He does
the same here, with lots of disgustingness, in a form of people infected
with something that turns them into zombies. It sad mostly because there
is nice camerawork, lots of quality acting (check especially Josh Brolin
as medical doctor), and lots of quality humor (check the child and
mother moment, as well as the first meeting with an infected patient).
It's like some sort of 'fuck you' from the director.
