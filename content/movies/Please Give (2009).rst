The uniqueness of the opening scene (breasts), and it's song, provides a
good hint that you are about to be treated to something special, and the
movie does not disappoint, all until the needless cheating moment. It's
very well-made and well-acted, and the spa gal has never been this
interesting. The dialog is incredible.
