Ever went into a movie and realise within the first minute it's not
going to be any good? If proven right, it can become a painful
experience, and you can't wait for the end to come, because it's not so
bad that it's unwatcheable. What made me notice the early badness? The
very first two people to appear on screen (`Paul Bettany`_ and `Karl
Urban`_) and their poses (they are vampire killers) are very telling.
Worse still, we have `Cam Gigandet`_ as the sidekick. The story is so
unexciting, the climax is rushed and the post-apocalyptic world is
recycled and unexplained. The only bright spot I can remember is the
vampires themselves even though the design isn't original, for we've
seen something similar in *I Am Legend* and *The Descent*.
