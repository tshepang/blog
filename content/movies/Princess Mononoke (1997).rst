Princess Mononoke (1997)
========================

I watched this with high expectation, due the high critical acclaim it
possesses, but now have to wonder that the fuck is wrong with these
people. The story, an epic, resonates a bit with environmental care, so
I guess that's part of its appeal, but the animation and visual design
is crappy as hell, and so is the dialog (likely partly because of shitty
translation).
