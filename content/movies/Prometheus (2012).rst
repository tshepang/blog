The suspense, which runs the entire length of the movie, is a bit hard
to bear. The movie also feels incomplete, some stuff left unexplained:

-  why is the robot sinister
-  why does the robot help near the end
-  what's up with the old man
-  ...

The creature design of the humanoid creatures is incredible. The ending
is solid, and the famous alien, which is in baby form, is flawless.
