Quantum of Solace (2008)
========================

This Bond we find in *Quantum of Solace* must be the most intense yet,
and partakes in equally-intense thrills, and in what is perhaps the best
Bond movie yet. Actually the movie's first half (and its action) is so
good that it reminds of (the superior) `Taken`_, even though it got
spoilt by the revenging beauty (incompetent performance, stale character
and subplot) and an even worse finale.
