============

Given the top-of-the-range quality of the animation and character
design, this is a largely unnteresting adventure story of an
annoyingly-deceptive reptile in thirsty Wild West town. Lucily there's
some colorful characters:

-  the freedom-fighter gal with her heavy America South accent
-  the old and wise guy who got run over by a car, with his heavy
   Mexican accent
-  the snake, whose creation must have been the single most complex
   character in the whole movie, and perhaps among the most complex
   digital characters ever

-

There's great voice talent, but the story, not so much.
