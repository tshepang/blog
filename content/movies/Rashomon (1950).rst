Rashomon (1950)
===============

Of the highest-rated of Akira Kirosawa's movies, *Rashomon* is given the
stature of `Seven Samurai`_, if not more, but for me it's just a dumb
story with bad acting. In fact I found its ridiculousness unbearable in
this revisit. Regardless, Toshiro Mifune is really an interesting actor,
but happened to be given a shitty role, where he practically is a
madman. I also enjoyed the performance of the inquisive guy,
though he overdoes it, not to mention silly grins and forced laughter.
