Real Steel (2011)
=================

The kid actor playing the lead's son, Dakota Goyo, gives a real good
performance and his character is really interesting and unpredictable,
just the like the movie. The lady playing the lead's love interest is
quite good too. The movie is strange, directed in an unusual manner,
such that I didn't enjoy much of it, especially the first half. It
started being a little fun when I started seeing some action on stage,
but there wasn't even enough of that.

The asshole levels of the lead character (played by Hugh Jackman in a
surprisingly decent performance) are hard to bear, when he is being an
ass. The redneck is given a memorable performance.
