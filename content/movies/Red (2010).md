I didn\'t like this much (John Malkovich was annoying, Morgan Freeman
uninteresting, and so was Bruce Willis and the girlfriend). But I really
like the eye-pleasing [Rebecca Pidgeon], who plays the opponent\'s boss.
I just wish that opponent would have been played by a better actor than
[Karl Urban].
