I didn't like this at all (John Malkovich was annoying, Morgan Freeman
uninteresting, and so was Bruce Willis and the girlfriend). But I really
like the eye-pleasing `Rebecca Pidgeon`_, who plays the opponent's boss.
I just wish that opponent would have been played by a better actor than
`Karl Urban`_.
