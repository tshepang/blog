This is a nice find. I bumped onto it by accident. The first scene got
me sold (gritty, with good performances, especially the amazing Chiwetel
Ejiofor, as well as good direction). It does not disappoint throughout,
and it\'s amazingly unpredictable. I wish it could have been longer,
with more of the loose ends tied.
