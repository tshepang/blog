Remember Me (2010)
==================

It starts in a very promising way, with a well-directed
robbery-and-murder scene, complete with great camerawork, pacing, and
acting. Sadly, the movie soon turns into some soppy, uninteresting
romance, with two uninteresting lovers, whose characters appear to
desperately feel interesting. Luckily we get good performances from
Chris Cooper (as always) and Pierce Brosnan, both playing the respective
fathers.

The entire exercise feels pointless though, and the Sep 11 reference
needless. What the fuck is up with that?
