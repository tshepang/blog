Not intense enough to do justice to the subject matter, perhaps due to
being a little too unrealistic. It is however very well-made, has
quality cinematography and production design, and is well-acted. Forest
Whitaker is a pleasure to watch, as usual, Jude Law is damn gorgeous,
and the lady that plays his wife even more so. The girlfriend is not
interesting, sadly.

As for the subject matter, it would have been nice if there was some
explaination of how such cruelty came to be socially acceptable. How did
it happen that death came in such an unquestioned manner?
