Requiem For A Dream (2000)
==========================

:tags: masterpiece



It's only truly masterful/great movies which offer great experiences on
a revisit as on the first viewing. This, Darren Aronofosky's disturbing
masterpiece, is one of them. The story is quite simple, focusing on 4
characters, and each having drug additions, and it's about the horrid
results that follow. There is good humor here and there, and there is a
whole lot of good acting.

One thing that I hardly pay attention to is movie scores, but the one in
here is among the most memorable, and it matches the movie quite well.

One tear-jecking moment is when the mommy character (played by `Ellen
BUrstyn`_) expresses the high shitness levels of her life to son. Sadly
this mommy character is a little overdone (as if retarded), though her
acting is pretty good.

--------------

A far `superior review`_, even though it is a lot more negative than
mine.
