I found the first third unbearable, and the whole thing is rather trite
and recycled. Things become better when the bird wearing a bottle cap as
a hat charms me. The street celebrations are beautiful. Regardless, this
isn\'t Pixar-quality, complete with shitty, supposed-to-be-kool music
and singing.
