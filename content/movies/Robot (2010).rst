Robot (2010)
============

Though incredibly shallow, formulaic, and ludicrous, it is entertaining
at times. Also the beauty of the leading lady is without flaw and her
dance moves wonderful (there's stupid full-length music sequences a few
times in the movie), and sex appeal nearly absent (though I would not
refuse an invitation).

The anger the creator shows towards the robot is annoying (both given
unsatisfying performances), and is most unbearable at the moment when he
gets to break it apart. It's too common `a flaw in Hollywood movies`_,
and it's sad to see it in a movie from a different market. The anger is
totally unjustfified because the robot has that time done various good
deeds, including saving a girl from being raped, saving a number of
people from fire, as well a helping woman in difficult labour. All that
is conveniently forgotten... it's just unberarable.
