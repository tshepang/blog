Romance (1999)
==============

The imagery imagined by the lead character, one where women expose their
lower bodies for the pleasure of men they cannot see, is powerful. It
has stayed with me for years, and is one of the main reasons I watched
the movie again, though it lasts less than a minute.

The movie itself is pointless, and feels like a waste of time. The
characters that are given a chance to speak blubber way too much
philosophical non-sense. Many of the scenes are tiring, for example
showing the entire sequence of a woman undressing, or being bonded for
sexual pleasure... twice. There is likely a message here, but am perhaps
too dumb to notice.
