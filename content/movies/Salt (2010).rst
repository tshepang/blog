Salt (2010)

**pros**

-  Anjelina Jolie here is the female answer to Matt Damon in the
   *Bourne* trilogy (and even exceeds him in terms of what she achieves,
   making hers the most heroic female character in memory).
-  As always, her acting is satisfactory, and so is the story, which is
   the edge-of-your-seat sort.
-  I also enjoyed the performance of the guy playing her Russian
   trainer.
-  The action direction is quite good, and so is the production design
   (check the interior of the church).

**cons**

-  I found the romance between Salt and hubby unconvincing. Perhaps it's
   the lack of chemistry, or just weak writing.
-  I wish the cinematography had more of a gritty (grainy?) look to it.
   As it is, it looks more like some documentary, and that doesn't fit
   the subject matter.

[**sidenote**] Third time I watch this, and I enjoyed it more than the
second time.
