Saw: The Final Chapter (2010)
=============================

An early scene, involving the gal cheating on two guys, was very
promising. That our gal was so fine also did help, and is the fact that
the torture was on public display. This made it look like it actually
had a fatter budget, and this got me excited. The only other moment that
was well-done was the torture of the racist, and this is due to it's
great production design and casting. The rest of the farce was worn out.
Luckily the movie was more enjoyable than it's predecessor, *Saw IV*.

The whole premise of the series is actually interesting (though I sure
hope no one would tries to imitate it), and I wish it was limited to the
initial ideology, whereby the victims' decisions involved only them. But
it seems to the writers that wasn't exciting enough, and there was
instead an insistence on having it been done to others too, who were
often innocent (e.g. you go through some horrid torture OR your wife
dies). Sounds like desperate writing to me.
