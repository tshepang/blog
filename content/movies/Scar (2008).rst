A run-of-the-mill horror that, luckily, has pretty gals and decent
camerawork. There is nothing new and the twist is underwhelming. What I
like about it is that it's not pretentious, and is devoid of arrogance.

When people spend so much effort on a movie, I wonder how they the
justify the question, *what makes this stand above the rest?*.
