Schindler's List (1993)
=======================

I haven't seen this one probably in over ten years, and it's not quite
as good as I remember. I even found the performances rather lacking and
that includes Liam Neeson's title character. I'm a fan of the guy, but
what he does here is almost embarassing, and he's far outdone by the
movie's best performer, Ralph Fiennes (the villain). One other
notably-bad performance is that of the lady playing the Jewish love
interest of our villain. Ben Kingsley, who plays the accountant, is as
uninteresting as usual. Nothing else stands out, although it was fun to
watch the cartoonish portrayal of the guy making a hinge.

Luckily, the movie is bearable throughout it's entire 180+ min running
time. Also, stories of heroism are ever so appealing.

Comparison with other movies set around the Holocaust:

-  *Sophie's Choice* did a better job, even though the coverage of the
   subject material was very brief.
-  *Life is Beautiful* offered a far more moving experience, even though
   it was partly a comedy.
