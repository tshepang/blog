Season of the Witch (2011)
==========================

It started reasonably well and slowly worked its way down into badly
recycled material. The adventure feels artificial, the villain
uninteresting, the characters shallow as shit, but worst of all is what
happens near the end. In my (pitiful) memory, this is the second worst
movie Nicolas Cage has been in (remember *Ghost Rider*).
