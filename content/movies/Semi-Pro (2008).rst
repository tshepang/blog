Very funny (favorite moment is the unloaded gun scene), and some of the
humor is very original. The movie is in the style (the goofiness) of the
other Will Ferrell vehicle, *Blade of Glory*. `André 3000`_ is
interesting to watch and, with talent like this, me wonders why he isn't
working more regularly in movies.
