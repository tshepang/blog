Seven Psychopaths (2012)
========================

My favorite utterance from the movie:

    A hooker comes out of the bathroom in a beautiful red dress. She
    says, "Would you like to make love? Or, should we have an
    intelligent conversation instead? I've been reading a lot of Noam
    Chomsky lately; I think he's a marvel"

It is a very well-made dark comedy with some wonderful performances. My
favorites are `Tom Waits`_ and the Vietnamese psychopath. The latter
also happens to be lucky enough to be one talk who gets to experience
some moments with that one special hooker. I also loved the old lady in
hospital, who also happens to be gorgeous. Sam Rockwell, Christopher
Walken, and Woody Harrelson are impressive, but this is
business-as-usual for them, so nothing novel there.

Politically, the movie is important in that it does, in a rather subtle
way, condemn homophobia. It also promotes interracial romantic
relationships, which I always find beautiful.

--------------

`The earlier movie`_, written and directed by the same person, is a
superior work of art in many ways, excluding humor.
