Seven Samurai (1954)
====================

For a movie made in the sixties, I found the camerawork impressive.
Another feat is that the movie is entertaining for its entire running
length of 3 hours. Sadly there is way too much idiotic characters,
including from the great Toshiro Mifune, though I liked the movie's most
important scene, that where he reveals his real ancestry. The other
scenes I liked a lot are those showing the search for the samurai. I
found the characterisations of these warriors impressive.
My favorite was the quite one, the most skilled of the 'seven'.
