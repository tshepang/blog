Seven Samurai (1954)
====================

For a movie made in the sixties, I found the camerawork impressive.
Another feat is that the movie is entertaining for its entire running
length of 3 hours. Sadly there is too much idiocy/retardation is some of the
characters, including by the great Toshiro Mifune.
I did however love the movie's most important scene,
where his character reveals his actual ancestry.

My favorite part of the movie is the search for the samurai.
I found the characterisations of these warriors impressive.
My favorite of them is the quite one,
who also happens to be the most skilled of the 'seven'.
