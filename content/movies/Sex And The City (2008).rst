Someone might feel a need to slap me on my wrist, but I'm seriuosly not
a fan of romantic comedies/chick flicks (I'm not the target market,
duh!). I've never been much interested in the tv show in which this is
based for similar reasons. But I relented, and in turn got punished by
2hr+ of age-old formula that made me hate the genre in the first place.
Regarding the story, the musings regarding sexual/romantic relationships
are quite sickening (think `*Eat Pray Love*`_).
