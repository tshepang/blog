Shaolin (2011)

An embarrassingly bad, recycled shit, which would have one fooled early
on (decent camerawork and atmosphere). Sadly, soon enough we see some
bad acting and dramatisations. Not even the martial arts rescue it. The
brutality is laughable.

No, I must find something positive. Ummmm... I like the sworn brother,
the one who proposes arranged marriage. The villain's performance is
quite good as well, but only before he gains power, because afterwards
he brings some unexciting swagger, you know the one that has been done
how many times before.

It's okay to rehash stuff, but if you do it worse than everyone else,
eish! I hate pretentious movies. This one wanted to be a memorable epic,
a masterpiece even, but it's a cheap imitation. Disgusting.
