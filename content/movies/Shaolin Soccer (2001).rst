Shaolin Soccer (2001)
=====================

Very shallow story, very entertaining direction (best of which are the
fantasy martial arts), very funny in places, and very charming, but
muddled with cheap and childish ethics. A totally beloved gal, who
happens to be funny too (check the ghost dress and the sexy pose).
