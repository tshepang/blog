The movie is full of excellent performances:

-  Julianne Moore, but has she ever fucked up in her career?
-  The lady who lost 3 sons; superb portrayal of grief.
-  Jonathan Rhys Meyers, with a caveat that he plays a character whose
   body is used as host by a number of souls (personalities of dead
   people), so he doesn't always keep up.

The cinematography, production, and direction are top-notch. The script
(and dialogue) is quite good as well, until we get beyond roughly an
hour, where, like many movies that start well, the writers don't know
where to take the script. That's where the explanation of the story must
come in, and maybe it's because I find supernatural claims shitty, but
it's just not done well. We get offerred standard horror fare, nothing
good enough to justify the whole thing. Fuck, there's even a moment
where our heroic psychologist plays action hero. Eish!

[**sidenote**] Regardless of the shitness, I think the movie received
too little attention from mainstream critics and audience. We must
probably blame the marketing team too.
