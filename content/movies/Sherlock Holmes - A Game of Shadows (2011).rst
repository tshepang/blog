Sherlock Holmes - A Game of Shadows (2011)
==========================================

Stephen Fry, John Carrol Lynch lookalike, is a wonderful actor. He gives
the movie's most interesting performance, while also playing its most
interesting character.

I found the storyline a little complex and the dialog a little too
smart-ass. The action is decent but over-stylized and overly-frantic,
and the visual effects sometimes eye-popping (e.g. the escape from the
military base).
