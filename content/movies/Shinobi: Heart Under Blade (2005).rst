Shinobi: Heart Under Blade (2005)
=================================

Oriental fantasy is my kinda movie genre. The characters in this one are
as colorful as a peace-loving man effortlessly killing over a dozen
ninjas, or a super-sweet doll who happens to be among the top warriors
in the village. The story is rather silly, where self-sacrifice is the
order of the day. It's edgy at the same time, but is too poetic for my
liking (think *Hero* or *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*) and there's
isn't enough of great martial arts choreography (think any movie
choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping).
