Shoot 'Em Up (2007)
===================

:tags: 2009-movie, decent



The main villain is annoying to watch and the gorgeous love prostitute
uninteresting. The lead character is interesting enough, and so is the
action. Some of the humor, none of which is actually funny, is taken a
bit too far (one guy kills another with a carrot).

I liked the camerawork but not the negative view the writers have on the
customers of sex workers. It's too shallow, just like the movie, though
luckily it doesn't pretend not to be.
