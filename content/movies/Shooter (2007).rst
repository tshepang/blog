Similar in style to the *Bourne* series, it also happens to be quite
entertaining, although three of the major characters are given bad
performances (the lead, the love interest, and the black guy in power).
The subject matter is of a fearsome concept of sniper work, except that,
as regards to the story, it's not convincing how far the bad guys went
for the cash payoff.
