Shortbus (2007)

:tags: decent, 2007-movie



The characters in this movie express sexual desire to levels most people
are not brave enough to, which is a bit of a plus. The peformances are
of decent quality, but the level of eccentricity of some of the
characters not so kool. Sure they are respectable for pushing the
boundaries, but there is also that thing called taste/sense:

-  what the fuck is up with the girl with the shitty hairstyle
-  the club owner (smart but not so interesting)
-  or the therapist, whose outburst was not at all realistic, nor is her
   stupid belief (women cannot orgasm) believable, especially for
   someone who deals with workings of the mind.

It is like the makers wanted something profound, but lacked the writing
talent, which itself is not bad... just okay. The ending is boring and
the movie pointless, except insofar as to push the boundaries in
blurring the distinction between porn and not-porn.
