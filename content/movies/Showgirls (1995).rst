================

Back then when I saw it for the first time, I was excessively impressed
with it, which made it hard to comprehend why the heck it got such `low
ratings`_. If we remove 'excessively', that's still the case. It's got
good performances and a very fitting lead role. It's very energetic and
intense, but it's too full of frantic, over-the-top acts (the
near-accident caused by the guy offering a lift, the first meeting with
sweet gal, the lap dance, ...), which are rather disturbing, divorcing
the movie from reality. The brutality shown at the end wasn't needed,
and is neither explanied nor justified. The movie remains excellent.
