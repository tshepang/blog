Shrek Forever After (2010)
==========================

I didn't expect much from this one, given that I find the series rather
overrated, bar the 2nd movie. But this one is quite an experience, and
far superior to any of them.

I liked:

-  the kid that insists on Shrek screaming
-  Donkey was actually interesting
-  the warrior Fiona was great to watch
-  the villain was fun to watch, and his mannerisms reminds of that of
   the title character of *Megamind*
-  the story is a lotta fun
-  the Ogres species was fun to watch, and it was interesting to note
   that he looked like nothing compared to some of them; character
   design is amazing; check especially the cook
-  great humor: the villain serving the witches; the cook proposing
   serving food during battle; the meet between fat cat and donkey
-  the early scenes in which Shrek harks back to the early,
   freedom-filled, days

**update**:

Movie revisits can be real strange. The first time I watched this one, I
deemed it a near-masterpiece, but a revisit proved it not much better
than the others in the *Shrek* franchise. It makes me wonder... maybe my
mood was different. It's not as bad as the worst in the series (*Shrek
3*), but it doesn't seem as good as the 2nd (*Shrek 2*).

Technically, it's a little disappointing (the human faces are really
bad, not much better than the original *Toy Story* (1995). None of the
visuals are any impressive either, well other than Donkey's fur, which
sometimes look photo-realistic. Luckily the new ogres are interesting,
far more interesting than Shrek himself, my most favorite being the
cook. And of the previous elements I watched, Fiona was no longer
interesting, and villain not as much fun nor is the story.
