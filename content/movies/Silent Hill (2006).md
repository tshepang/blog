Some of the creature design which is quite good, best of which is
[Pyramid Head], the horrific blade-dragging monster, whose made even
more memorable by his countless bug-like companions. Second favorites
are the supersexy, faceless, murderous [nurses]. These pleasures were
however spoiled by a miscast/unconvincing villainous lady and the weak
story. This is not to mention random stupid things, like the leading
lady running away from the cop for no reason, or the silly gal whose
hate leads to her being skinned alive, etc.

This is how I felt first time I watched it, and is no longer the case:

That early scene was nice yes, but calling it *extremely beautiful* is
extreme. As for the visual mastery comment, it must have been mere
virgin excitement.
