Sin City's 'The Hard Goodbye'
=============================

:date: 2008-04-11



Watching Mickey Rourke's character as he goes on violently investigating
the murder of his beloved Goldie never stops getting me excited. Easily
the best of Sin City's stories, "The Hard Goodbye" is made great by the
guy's humour (as he narrates), the imaginatively-illustrated, cartoony
action, not to mention his super-human strength (and I'm a sucker for
the beyond-real).
