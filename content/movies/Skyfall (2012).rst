It is overall a disappointing experience, considering I watched with
anticipation, given its `solid predecessor`_. I however have to give
kudos to Daniel Craig's befitting performance. I liked also the first
chase scene, which must have the most daring motorbike stunts I have yet
seen in movies, not to mention an unexpected ending. Most of the rest of
the movie does not live to the expectations set by that opening. The
story is not good either, nor the villain interesting.
