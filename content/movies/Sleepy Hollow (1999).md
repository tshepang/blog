I had great fun watching this. I can\'t even tell which I enjoyed more
between it and another superb Tim Burton movie, [\*Alice In
Wonderland\*], nor which is better. The humor, which is solely driven by
the very capable Johnny Depp, is spot-on, while the mightily desirable
Christina Ricci is put there as an excuse for a love interest. The
character design of the headless horseman is wonderful, and so are the
caricatures of the villagers, especially the priest; Tim Burton is
master of caricatures, and I love quality caricatures. His imagery and
atmosphere is also great.
