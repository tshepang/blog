This movie is intense and has so many gems spread all over it that I\'m
tempted to call it masterpiece. The experience was better than the first
time around.

Some of what caused this celebration:

-   Taraji P. Hanson
-   Taraji P. Hanson\'s rifle
-   Common carrying Alicia Keys
-   FBI poser
-   concept (multiple pro-killers targeting one guy)
-   mafia telephone conversation
-   the murderous neo-nazi trio

Like [Fight Club] before it, the movie is packed too much of goodness.
