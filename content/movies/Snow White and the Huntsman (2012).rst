Snow White and the Huntsman (2012)
==================================

I went into this one with anticipation, only to be met with lots of
careless direction, as if the thing was rushed. It is also the worst
performance of Charlize Theron in memory, and the only one I found
embarassing. However, the worst performance in the movie is that of the
lead character. She's pretty of course, but that's all!

There are isolated moments of beauty and decent visual effects. Not one
of the seven dwarfs are interesting, even though many were portrayed by
good actors. Why didn't they use real dwafs?
