Something Borrowed (2011)
=========================

Some day I should simply stop punishing myself so much. I should learn
to quit the first sign I see trouble. My problem is high levels of
curiosity, for I'm often worried what I must miss, while wary of passing
judgement on a movie before watching its entirety.

It's kinda hard to find an original and good romantic drama/comedy, and
worse still, they tend to wallow in unbearable cheesiness. This one is
worsened by uninteresting leads, the Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst
look-alikes. It's fucking weird how come movies like this still get made
at all, because there's absolutely nothing new in it.
