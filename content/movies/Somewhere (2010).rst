Somewhere (2010)
================

The lead character of *Somewhere* is rich, famous, and easily fucks
ultra-hot gals, yet the only bright thing in his life seems to be her
beloved daughter (who is given a flawless portrayal). This feeling of
purposelessness is well-punctuated by Sofia Coppola's superb direction
of loong takes and a story where nealy nothing happens. This movie is a
greater favorite to the director's earlier *Lost in Translation*, which
covered similar territory; the lead is far more interesting, and does
not have that irritating Japanese tv host.
