Spirited Away (2001)
====================

It's interesting to have a movie that is both spooky and enchanting.
There's a bunch of strange characters, and everyone of them are designed
badly (what's up with these Japanese animators?), but the story keeps it
all interesting. This is despite the clumsy 2D animation and shallow
character development. The lead character is admirable for her
kindheartedness, and it's touching seeing characters surrounding her
with affection, one of which is a spoilt baby and another, a greedy and
lonely monster that swallows sentient beings (a human, a frog, and some
other creature I can't identify).
