Quality direction, production design, cinematography, and cast. A decent
story which luckily doesn't end in the tired way romances tend to be. I
enjoyed this more the first time around, mainly due to the sexuality
surrounding the man-whore and the rich lawyer. I enjoyed the
open-mindedness that she expressed, though she later on became
attached/possessive enough to find the jealousy unbearable.
