Nice performance by Brendan Fraser as the lead, and an even better one
by [the guy playing the villain]. The film is quite enjoyable (not a
boring moment) and the romance beautiful. I don\'t remember a woman
fearing her own child as is the case with mother of gangster. Good
direction and acting there.

[This quality review] was not as positive.
