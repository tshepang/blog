This one is typical of those unbearable age-old Hollywood movies. It\'s
[overrated] as hell, and I\'m now curious what it\'s appeal was.

**pros**

-   He may be a caricature, but the butler is interesting to watch.
-   The wannabe writer is so wantable, and so is her friend.

**cons**

-   Shitty storyline.
-   Unconvincing scenarios.
-   Overacting by the lead lady, playing a yesteryear star.
