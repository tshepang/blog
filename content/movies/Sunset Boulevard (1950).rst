Sunset Boulevard (1950)
=======================

This one is typical of those unbearable age-old Hollywood movies. It's
`overrated`_ as hell, and I'm now curious what it's appeal was.

**pros**

-  He may be a caricature, but the butler is interesting to watch.
-  The wannabe writer is so wantable, and so is her friend.

**cons**

-  Shitty storyline.
-  Unconvincing scenarios.
-  Overacting by the lead lady, playing a yesteryear star.
