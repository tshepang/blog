Some nice performances by the kids, especially the explosives lover, the
lead character, the pretty gal, and my favorite, the movie director. I
loved also that of the guy playing the gal's father. The train crash is
the movie's best visual effects moment, and among the best crashes ever
in my movie-watching history. Character design of the creature, the
spider-like villain, could be a lot better.
