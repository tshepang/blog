Great set design, camerawork, and costume design; a very dark story with
some disgusting elements; a very unbearable musical style (the singing
is often embarassing, and not very well-made, and exposes some bad
acting). I like the ugly actor (the aid of the evil judge), but he's a
little too clown-like to celebrate.
