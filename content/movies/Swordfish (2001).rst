Swordfish (2001)
================

John Travolta is interesting but the movie is the opposite, and is badly
written. It desperately tries to feel kool and fails, except for
Travolta, who sadly plays the same character he 'always' plays (no
effort). Halle Berry is extra pretty, but her character is shit and so
is everyone else.
