Swordsman II (1992)
===================

The romantic relationship between Jet Li's lead character and that of
the lead villain (he didn't suspect anything about his/her
villainy/sexuality) is both the most important and my favorite in the
movie. This lead character is surrounded by at least two other lovely
women (me want them), both of whom appear to have the hearts for him,
but he doesn't once make a move on them.

It's a very low budget movie, but the martial arts choreography is
impressive. The direction is a little unfocused, and the humor does get
in the way of that focus... the balance between comedy and drama isn't
quite right, as is so common with old Jet Li movies.
