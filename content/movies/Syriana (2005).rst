Syriana (2005)
==============

Here is my initial review:

    Syriana is an uncompromising examination of government-sponsored
    corporate evil and an idiotic oil-rich monarchy that condones it,
    with a surprise ending. It's a minimalist, yet powerful, narrative.

A revisit proved not as impressive, and dont remember what was
surprising about the ending. The quiet and distrinctive style of
direction gives it a fresh feel, although the quit treatment tends to
make it boring in places.

Not all performances are interesting, especially the investigator with a
troubled housemate. I did not enjoy watching the middle-East kids
either.
