Another case where white people are portrayed as both retarded and
cruel, with bad performers. The lead actor is fun to watch and the
leading is a pleasure to the eye. All characters are shallow as fuck but
the martial arts are decent, though often uninteresting and some fights
are too long. The hair thing is ludicrous.
