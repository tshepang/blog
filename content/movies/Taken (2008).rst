Taken (2008)
============

A top-notch thriller, complete with enthralling and fast-paced action
and a solid cast, led by a very credible Liam Neeson. The intensity
matches that of any movie in the trend-setting *Bourne* trilogy, though
with an evidently lower budget, and therefore less gloss, which is
pretty much welcome (I found those movies rather wasteful, most visibly
in their chase sequences). In this one movie, there are two chases
sequences, and I feel the first one should have been cut short,
especially beacuse it wasn't very interesting, and the movie feels too
intelligent to be yet-another noisy actioner.

I've noticed the movie has received much negative criticism, which I
found very strange, especially the great skill in which the material was
handled. Much of the complaints had to do with it having implausible
plot points, and I guess that I enjoyed it so much that I either didn't
notice, or that such weaknesses were really insignificant. Many of them
were probably just hypocrites, giving honors to less convincing movies.

I found the subject material (sex slavery) quite scary and is expertly
handled. The movie is therefore important beyond just providing
entertainment.
