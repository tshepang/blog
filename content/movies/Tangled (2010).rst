Tangled (2010)

An enchanting fantasy with superb character design (the evil old lady,
the drunkards, and the 2 outlaws), amazing action sequences, and nice
humor. It's originality is in having a horse in a different role than in
anything I've seen yet.

The ending ('climax') feels forced, and does not do justice to the rest
of the movie; the movie is a musical, and none of it is embarassing, but
the love song (on the boat) is the low point... boring.

[**sidenote**] I didn't expect much from this one, simply because I
never heard it mentioned before. Note also that, for a few years now, I
don't really check out what's on the circuit.
