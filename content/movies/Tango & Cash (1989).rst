Tango & Cash (1989)

A faity-tale of a story with plenty of holes, but is a whole lot of fun.
I hardly ever enjoy Kurt Russel's performances, but this one was far
more bearable. Stallone has always been charismatic on screen, and the
gal playing her sister is ultra-gorgeous (though very unconvincing).
Some of the bad guys are mere comic relief (check the guy with massive
jaws; check they guy with a pony-tail, the one who looks constipated).
Good ole cheap action-comedy.
