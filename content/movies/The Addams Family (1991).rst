========================

It is showing its age (camerawork, direction, visual effects), but still
got its charms. Check for example the husband and wife team who head the
family in question, even though the female side appears underused.
Christina Ricci is also wonderful as the daughter, and I also liked the
`Frankenstein-like family butler`_. These are the only interesting
characters, and all others are either uninteresting, badly-developed,
annoying, or practically non-existent.

The movie is otherwise quite shallow and very passive, even for a
comedy. It's also a comedy, but is not really funny, especially the
first half of it.
