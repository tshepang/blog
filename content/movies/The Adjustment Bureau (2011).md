A well-made and unusual sci-fi about some humanoid super-beings that run
the world. They remain unexplained, and they attempt to get the Matt
Damon character (good job) to be American president. Part of achieving
that is getting him away from his favorite gal, and although they give
something of a flimsy excuse, it makes the plot interesting. That\'s
despite that fact that the romance is overdone.
