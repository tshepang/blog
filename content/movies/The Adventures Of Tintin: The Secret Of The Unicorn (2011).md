The chase sequence in the Arab city is among the most complex action
sequences I have seen in any movie. This isn\'t praise\... [I\'m not a
fan of such excess], and this must have been seriously expensive. The
rest of it is moderately interesting, and the animation highly-detailed,
and at times highly-sophisticated. It did not, however, result in any
wow moment, but I appreciate the one detail of the Captain\'s convincing
eyes near the end.
