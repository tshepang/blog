The Air I Breathe (2008)
========================

The movie has three parts: the first got me excited due to superb
direction and nice storytelling; the 2nd doesn't lose superb direction
but gets tedious; the 3rd makes me wonder why the writers bothered, but
luckily has one desirable gal, the one with a rare blood type.

The whole thing turns out pointless (and stupid) at the end.
