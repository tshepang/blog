The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)
=============================

It is not really a supreme reboot, but it is an okay one. It does have
some exciting effects, and I most especially love the fights between the
hero and the villain. The love interest is not interesting, nor is any
of the characters who fill the movie. Well, maybe except the villain,
but only when in lizard form. The story is merely okay, and is bad at
times, e.g. the help the hero gets near the end with the cranes and all
(WTF!).

One of the complaints I had with the super-hero is where so much web
material came from, and the movie at least attempts to explain it
properly.
