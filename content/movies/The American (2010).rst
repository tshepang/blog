The American (2010)
===================

A very fresh assassin movie with great romance (did you see that gal?)
and sound effects. The story is so thin (and rather meditative) that I
don't know what to make of the movie. Many unexplained things happen,
but I guess that's not exactly a weakness. Rather, it's implied. The
uncomfortable situation our protagonist finds self in is quite edgy, and
it makes me wanna NOT become a gangster. The intense violence is always
unsettling, especially if it's merely imminent.
