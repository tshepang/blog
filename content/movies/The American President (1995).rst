The American President (1995)
=============================

It feels dated and Annette Benning is so damn pretty. It was hard not to
compare the movie with *The West Wing* tv series (I saw the first two of
its seasons). The whole thing feels shallow. The *oh shit! it really is
the president* thing is so lame and boring. Ok, there was too much of it
in the tv series. Why do I feel like some episodes of that series were
actually better. Sure the debates and storylines of that series were
deeper and more complex, but some episodes were actually more exciting
than this movie.
