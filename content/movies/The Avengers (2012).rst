The Avengers (2012)
===================

I found `Thor`_ very unsatisfactory, the 2 recent Hulk movies very
lacking, and `Captain America`_ fairly bad. That's why I was concerned
when I heard that my favorite comic book hero, Iron Man, would be paired
with them into one movie. I was also concerned by the fact that Jon
Favreau was not directing. Luckily the movie turned out even better than
the first 2 live action *Iron Man* movies, and of course far better than
the others mentioned above.

So, what makes it so good:

-  the movie is directed in a similar style to those 2 movies, including
   the clever humor and laid-back acting style

-  the movie has some of the best visual effects I've seen yet, and
   about as large-scale as any of the 3 *Transformers* movies, without
   the overly-frantic action where you can't figure WTF is going on

-  I found the reaction of the city public refreshingly-realistic,
   especially considering that this is a comic book adaptation

-  wonderful visual effects of course
