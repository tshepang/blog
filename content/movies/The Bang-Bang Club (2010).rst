The Bang-Bang Club (2010)

Comments on articles tend to be bad, and if you are lucky, just decent.
They are seldom outstanding though, as seen of `these ones`_ which are
critical of the article they respond to. Basically what's happening is
that the critic does offer a decent review, summrasising the story
nicely, but then resorts to unjustified criticism. That is sad,
especially because I found the movie quite good. Read them (the
comments), for they are better reviews than mine.

I am still going to given mine of course, by mentioning two main things
I really appreciate about the movie:

-  The portrayal South Africa (my home) is quite authentic. There was
   good research effort involved, to the point of even using the
   now-obsolete cash. The behavior and the utterances of Black people
   wasn't screwed up either (as it so often happens when foreigners set
   a movie here). The one complaint I have is that the white guys aren't
   convincing as South Africans, and there doesn't seem to be any real
   effort to mimick local accents. I even thought that the real life
   Club members were foreigners.

-  I was amazed by the performance of one local actor, `Patrick Shai`_.
   I've never given kudos to the guy, though he never got a heck of a
   lot of chances to strut his stuff (the local movie industry is nearly
   non-existent), but he really shined here, and gives the movie's best
   performance. I also find his character to be the movie's most
   interesting because, regardless of him being among the leaders of a
   small group of tribal killers, he also happens to have a soft side...
   literally a savior of one heroic guy. Watching him was a serious
   relief since I was concerned that these guys would be some sort of
   faceless aggresors/victims. Sure about all of them were, but at least
   there was him, and one other guy saddened by the death of wife and
   child.

This is an important movie, and it's sad that it hasn't achieved the
populariy it deserves. I'm still not going to claim it's a masterpiece
because, other than that performance, I'm not sure I wanna give it a
repeat viewing. It's not because it's unpleasant. It just feels that
what kept me glued were moments that won't be so thrilling second time
around. I don't know, I'll see.

**nit-picks**:

-  That scene depicting `vulture and child in hungry Sudan`_ should not
   have been attempted, or at least removed from the movie. It adds
   nothing to the movie, and too iconic a moment of history to be given
   such a lame attempt. For one, the child in the movie didn't look as
   bony.

-  I was left hungry for further exploration of the political climate of
   South Africa, beyond the unconvincing angry Black guy criticizing the
   White guys from profiting from taking photos of those in pain. In
   fact I think it's this sort of thing that makes the `'unjustified'
   criticism`_ I mentioned above make some sense. Such things tend to
   only dawn on me some time after the movie has ended.
