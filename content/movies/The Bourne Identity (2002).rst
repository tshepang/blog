The Bourne Identity (2002)
==========================

Very enjoyable and well-made, but it feels a little thin in terms of
production design, and the camerawork does not fit a thriller so
gripping (this was fixed in the 2 sequels). There's a bad performance by
the guy playing the African target, Clive Owen (playing one of the
assassins) was miscast and doesn't do a good job. Matt Damon (Jason
Bourne) pulls the character quite well, and that's kool for an actor I
don't like.
