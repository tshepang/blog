The Bourne Legacy (2012)
========================

The two facts, that the lead character is not Jason Bourne and that the
story occurs in parallel with the events in the Bourne trilogy, make for
very interesting narrative choices. I was not aware of this, so it was a
bit confusing until it was clear. Anyways, I am also very glad that the
new lead is quite capable, which is a relief since I was concerned,
considering I did not like him in `The Avengers`_. He still is not a
match of Matt Damon though.

The quality of the direction itself also matches that of the last two
movies in the trilogy, but the fight choreography is even better, among
the best I have seen in a non-martial arts movie. I did not like the
chase sequence so much, and the lead opponent could be better.
