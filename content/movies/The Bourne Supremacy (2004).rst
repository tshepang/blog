The Bourne Supremacy (2004)
===========================

All is better/bigger than the original: the intensity of the story, the
production design, the camerawork, and the car chase. All performances
are either good or beyond, if we don't count Karl Urban (the Russian
assassin).

My favorite bit of performance is given by the guy playing the assassin
Bourne duels early in the movie. Another well-directed one is the kid of
the murdered Russian couple. Joan Allen is as good as usual (not one
wrong move). Matt Damon does even better than in the first movie and so
does Julia Stiles.
