The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)
===========================

If we ignore the more spectacular car chase/crash, the movie is overall
lesser than the 2nd, but superior to the 1st of course. It's not the
best because it feels like a mere rehash, and doesn't bring much new to
celebrate, despite the fact the we get to know of Bourne's past, but
even that is told in some badly-made flashbacks.

The movie got camerawork and production design very similar to the 2nd
movie, with similar intensity fo story, except that I got a bit bored
(remember the rehashness of it). It's kinda strange because I remember
praising this concluding episode as superior to the rest.

Julia Stiles should not have been given a bigger role. She is not an
interesting enough actor. Even worse (worst performance in the trilogy)
is the guy playing the biker assassin. Other performances are decent
enough... nothing spectacular. Luckily, the last assassin here is played
quite well, better than any in the series.

[**sidenote**] One uncomfortable aspect of this movie is that Bourne
really takes too much physical punishment to continue going. It was
forgiveable in the previous 2 movies, but in here it's way too much (he
experiences so many heavy car crashes, and then simply walks out of
then). It's sad because the series has been as close to convincing as
action movies are allowed, and that added to the fun.
