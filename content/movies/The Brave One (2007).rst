The Brave One (2007)
====================

:date: 2008-05-01



I found The Brave One highly entertaining, and superbly-made, complete
with wonderful sound and a great lead performance by Jodie Foster; I
would have benefited from a better title, and it could have done without
the friendship between the vigilante and the cop, which results in some
unfortunate sugar-coating, detracting from the movie's tough approach.
