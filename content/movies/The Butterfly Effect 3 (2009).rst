The Butterfly Effect 3 (2009)
=============================

Far better than its `immediate predecessor`_, and a worthy successor to
`the original`_, this is a well-made and well-acted thriller with a
well-written script. The twist is interesting, though not entirely
convincing... feels forced. I enjoyed the performances of the 2
detectives, though no one was as good as overweight plant-loving
character, a sort of wise guide for the lead character. The 'rape' scene
is superbly made.
