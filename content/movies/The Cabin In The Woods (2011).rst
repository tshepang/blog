The Cabin In The Woods (2011)
=============================

This must be the weirdest of horror movies I've, and also surpsingly
highly rated. It still has those abused horror elements me hates so
much, and the only fresh thing it adds to the genre is the characters
who watch the victims in excitement. The leading gal is extra-desirable
but a little low on acting talent.
