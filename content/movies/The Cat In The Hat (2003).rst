One of these days I'm simply going to have to admit the world's movie
critics are quite strange, and I really can't rely on them for what they
consider excellent. Take for example their thoughts on `*The Cat in the
Hat*`_. This is because I find it really great family entertainment.
It's great fantasy and very funny, with great production design.
