As so often happens, it baffles me why so many critics [found this any
good]. The only thing worthy of praise is the sea good, who happens to
embody some of the best water effects I\'ve seen yet. Everything else
was just bland (cinematography, costumes, battles, acting, story,
production and creature design, character development), just like the
first movie.
