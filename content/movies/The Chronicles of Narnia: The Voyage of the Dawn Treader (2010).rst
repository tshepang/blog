I didn't watch the whole of this, the 3rd in the Narnia series. I just
flipped through to ensure I wasn't missing anything of worth:

-  The watery dolphins were likely a homage to my favorite visual
   effects work this year, the sea god from `the 2nd Narnia movie`_.
-  The lion looked better than on that predecessor, but not necessarily
   more realistic.
-  The water effects near the end of the movie, where it forms a
   wall-like effect, are amazing. This is some of the best water work
   ever.
-  My favorite visual effects work is the sea serpent. It's an
   equivalent of `the Kraken`_ (*Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's
   Chest*). As was the case with the sea god, this was an interesting
   departure from the series' obsession with bad character design.

I am not going to withstand the pain of watching the entire movie
though. I've suffered enough the with two predecessors.
