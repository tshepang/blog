The Dark Knight Rises (2012)
============================

I am in love with the voice and utterances of the masked villain. He is
also a villain so formidable that almost nowhere in the movie do you
doubt that he is not in control, until the silly twist of course. This
is in a movie whose makers ensured it was far bigger and more intense
than `the immediate predecessor`_. I also found it a lot more
entertaining, though of course there just cannot be anything matching
the incredible miracle that was Heath Ledger's The Joker.

There are stupid classic movie 'mistakes':

-  A knife removed from abdomen makes a metallic sound
-  There is very limited time to take the bomb as far away as possible,
   yet we see people kissing and exchanging goodbyes... so annoying
