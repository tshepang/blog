The Dictator (2012)
===================

With hilarius moments all over the place, much of which is unique,
fresh, and daring. The lead character, played by the brilliant comedian,
Sacha Baron Cohen, reminds me very much of the Adfam Sandler's in the
wonderful `You Don't Mess With the Zohan`_, only a lot better. The movie
also has very good production design.

There is one trashy scene where the lead helps deliver a child, but the
punchline actually makes it worth it.
