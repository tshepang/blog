The Duel (2000)
===============

The character of the king's investigator, with humorous and laid-back
fighting style, is fun to watch, though not nearly as much as the
ultra-sweet sister of the king. The martial are rdiculously overdone (we
know this is fantasy, but there's limits even there) and the visual
effects unsatisfactory. The long-awaited for duel is less than
impressive.

I enjoyed the ovie a lot more first time I watched it, mainly impressed
by the romantic aspect of it, but I think it was heavily affected by my
love for that king's sister. Check her massive eyes, and check her face
when sad, or when happy.
