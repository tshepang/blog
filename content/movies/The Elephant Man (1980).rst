The Elephant Man (1980)
=======================

The filmmakers made sure that the disfigured man looked really
disgusting, and the idea is rather challenging, especially because I'd
lose my appetite if I shared a table. That doesn't look very good
(what's the difference between me and the racists?).

The movie is too slow and not very interesting, as if the makers relied
only on the curiosity of this shitty-looking and not much else. Those
who mistreated this guy should have been portrayed in a more convincing
way, because they just look mindless, as if the director was desperate
to make them look bad, just in case we wouldn't notice.
