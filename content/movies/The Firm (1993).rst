The Firm (1993)

An reasonably enjoyable movie that is sadly showing its age. Luckily
there's many nice performances:

-  Holly Hunter: I didn't even notice it was here, until I saw the
   credits; it's been a while I guess; she plays the lover of the
   private investigator.
-  `Gary Busey`_: He's fun to watch as private investigator. He gets
   some of the movie's best dialogue. Also, I don't remember enjoying
   any of his performances, until now.
-  Ed Harris: This is one good actor, and I only wish he was given
   enough great roles, instead of playing second fiddle to shitty actors
   like Tom Cruise. The scene where he breaks in anger, where he reveals
   the size of his balls to the Tom Cruise character is solid.
-  David Strathairn: The character of the hero's brother was rather
   misplaced and was given too much importantance. It was just not
   needed for the story. That however shouldn't make us ignore the fact
   that it was performed well.

There's a bunch of desirable gals too, not least of which was the great
Holly Hunter herself. Another is the wife, and another (the most
desirable) is the lady who seduced our hero on the beach in what is
easily the silliest moment in the movie.

[**sidenote**] Now, this Gary Busy guy is one prolific muthafucka,
with over 120 movie appearances! I think most are shit though, as is
often the case with actors this active. Remember `Dennis Hopper`_?
