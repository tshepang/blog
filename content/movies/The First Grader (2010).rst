The First Grader (2010)
=======================

Touching drama about the oldest person (84) to start formal primary
school education. Well, it so happens that he met opposition (there's
isn't a shortage of idiots in the world). The guy playing him gives a
very good performance, and just as impressive are the schoolmates,
especially the kid with an artificial leg. She also happens to provide
the movie's most tear-jerking moment, where she mentions a future career
of choice.

What makes these kids all the more impressive is that they were taken
from just two primary schools, which makes me assume they were
untrained.

The story is paced a little too slow, although the horrendous past of
the old man is thrown in to help hold interest. Those flashbacks are too
frequent, unfortunately. Keeping the movie shorter would have been a
better solution.
