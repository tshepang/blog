The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)
======================================

Given that this was made by David Fincher, you know, the same guy who
made *Fight Club* and *Se7en*, it was way too underwhelming, too
average. The story, the acting, the direction, none outstanding. I get
the vibe that the work the movie is based on is quite famous, so maybe
this movie doesn't do it justice. This is easily Fincher's least
interesting, perhaps with the exclusion of his first, *Alien 3*.

Okay, I nearly forgot that the opening credits sequence was quite good.
That and the fact that I could not actually figure what was going on.
