The Green Hornet (2011)
=======================

The first part of the movie is better than the latter, with the humorous
antics of the title character, and the excellence of his sidekick, not
least of which is the coffee-making. The lead villain is also fun to
watch, especially with his the constant (and humorous) concern of the
fearsomeness of his image/presence. The split-screen moment, where
various bounty hunters are sent for the title character, is amazing, and
among the most innovative visuals I've seen in movies yet.

Sadly, the movie gets a little annoying when this title character stops
being funny (`and ungrateful`_), starting with the moment he shoots the
sidekick. There is also unexplained physical prowess, the sort that
makes the movie feel like passive entertainment, and the destruction
that happens in the movie's final action sequence is way too much. Why
the noise?
