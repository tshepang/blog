The Green Mile (1999)
=====================

The writers probably did not appear to care of looking silly, given the
amount of stupid events that happen (e.g. some oversized guy touches
crotch of another for some supernatural healing). The direction is
competent though, and so is some of the acting. My favorite was Sam
Rockwell even though he was not convincing in the role; he was just fun
to watch. Another good one was by `Doug Hutchison`_ as the hateful, and
easy-to-hate, prison guard. Michael Clark Duncan has an admirable body,
but am curious how it happened they decided to cast him for the role. It
is just so pointless, but I really love his body. Its size is however
inconsistently exagerrated.
