===========================

I didn't expect much from this since it was trashed by critics, but
found it quite entertaining, and filled with interesting characters. My
favorite is the character played by `Ken Jeong`_, a fun-loving criminal
with feminine mannerisms. One other great thing about the movie is the
setting, which portrays Bang Kok is some gritty, seedy city, where crime
is rampant and the police under-resourced. It feels authentic, whether
or not it's based on reality. It's a showcase of good production design.

Having watched the previous (and lesser) movie also makes one appreciate
this one more, even though the formula is the same.
