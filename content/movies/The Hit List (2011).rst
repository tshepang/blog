The Hit List (2011)
===================

It's got some good elements, and the lead actor, Cole Hauser, is really
great on screen. The direction of the opening scenes (following the
stressed-out hero, nd his meeting with the killer) is pretty good. The
violence near the end is quite weird, and mentioning it would be a
spoiler.

I would have appreciated a better budget and superior camerawork. Cuba
Gooding jnr. is badly cast as the killer (he's damn unconvincing). The
story is thing and shallow, and the cheating thing painted in a lighter
way was just unneeded, as if fucking is a greater cheating crime than
kissing. Really?
