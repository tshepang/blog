The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (2005)
==========================================

3 things I really like:

-  the narration
-  the animated inserts, which are accompanied by that quality narration
-  the character design and development of the Vogons; my favorite is
   the poet, and each second with him is a joy

The movie, which is rather quirky and not too well-written (it feels
incomplete), toys around with some interesting ideas, and feels really
weird. It, at the end, feels pointless. The character of the president
of the universe, though entertaining at first, gets annoying later,
especially with the 2nd head thing. The gal, when in the shower, looks
incredible.
