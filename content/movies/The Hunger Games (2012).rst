The Hunger Games (2012)
=======================

If we ignore the shallow non-sense about Americanism, I find `this
review`_, among the few negative ones on the movie, very true.
I find the movie an uninteresting waste of time, and therefore it's appeal is
mysterious to me. As mentioned in the review, there is a glaring lack of
explanation on the cruel situation some of the people find themselves
in. Not even the visual effects are really good, though I liked the
visual design of some of the sets.
