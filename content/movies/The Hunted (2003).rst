The Hunted (2003)
=================

:date: 2008-05-01



The Hunted does a great job on engaging me in a way reminiscent of
*Bourne Identity* trilogy given its intensity and edge-of-the-seat
excitement as well as hyper-capable lead characters, and these leads
(Benicio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones) provide top-class acts. By the
way, the fight sequences are beyond any I've seen, bar oriental martial
arts stuff.
