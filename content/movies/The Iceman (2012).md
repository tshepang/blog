[Michael Shannon] gives an excellent and unusual performance as a
fearsome contract killer, in a movie with excellent cinematography and
production design, and excellent writing. Another notable performance is
that of [Ray Liotta], even though he plays one of his usual characters,
only this time I really enjoyed him, perhaps even more than in [Smokin\'
Aces]. There is not one other performance that is lacking, and even
[Chris Evans] helped by hiding his not-too-talented face behind a large
beard.
