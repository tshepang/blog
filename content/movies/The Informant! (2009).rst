The Informant! (2009)
=====================

Not really interesting, and that's not helped by the rather untalented
(or should I say uninteresting?) Matt Damon who plays the title
character who reveals his company's price-fixing activities. It drags
and drags, and really paints a bad picture of this informant guy to the
point where you (I) end up hating him. The plot is overly complex, and
the director attempts to keep it light with a comic touch or two, but it
doesnt work. I seriously didn't enjoy this, even though I have to admit
that it's well-made (direction, sets, camerawork, script).
