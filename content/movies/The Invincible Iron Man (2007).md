It was strange watching this one, for the story is so different from the
two live-action movies (father is still alive; some sprinkling of
supernatural stuff; Pepper is much older, Tony Stark is boring, \....).
It was a fun watch too, other than that the story is pretty much
shallow, and offers nothing fresh.
