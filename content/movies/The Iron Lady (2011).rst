====================

A wonderful cast:

-  Meryl Streep is good as usual in the lead role, though I wasn't
   entirely satisfied with her portrayal of modern-day (frail) Margaret
   Thatcher.
-  The lady playing the young Margaret, Alexandra Roach, is amazing, her
   performance being the movie's most interesting. I'm even tempted to
   call it the movie's best, but am held back from that opinion given
   that it's pretty much carecatured.
-  The guy playing the modern day husband, Margaret's hallucination of a
   dead man, Jim Broadbent, offers nice and laid-back humor.

The direction is sohpisticated and smooth, though there's rather too
focus on the modern-day Margaret, with so many flashbacks that it's just
distracting. I also left the movie feeling like I still don't know
enough about this 20th century giant. Perhaps the treatment was a little
too humorous, and too soft, especially considering the great importance
of the issues involved in Margaret Thatcher's tenure as prime minister.
