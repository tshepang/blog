The Joneses (2009)

Demi Moore is still so damn gorgeous after all these years! The movie is
a real good play on the concept of *kool neighbors* even though it fails
to end it well. It takes the concept a little far, meaning they fail to
make it believable, but luckily the whole thing is kept entertaining.
The subplots (cheating hubby and homosexuality) were left ununsed and
were therefore needless, as if thw writers didn't have a filler... lack
of creativity?
