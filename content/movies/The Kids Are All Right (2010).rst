=============================

Julianne Moore and Annette Bening give incredible performances in
superbly-directed movie where they play lesbian mothers whose lives are
to be challenged by a stranger... sperm donor of their kids, also played
well by Mark Ruffalo. The issue is that he's made so kool that he's not
believable, and the contention he presents feels forced. It's an
excellent premise, and interesttingly one that I haven't seen explored
before, but the makers just didn't know where to take the story. I also
don't know what the point of it all is and it leaves a few questions
open.
