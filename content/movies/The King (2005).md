There is no shortage of good performances (I enjoyed watching the sweet
[Pell James] and the beautiful [Laura Harring], but none was nearly as
good as [Paul Dano]). That and a strange and unpredictable (and often
edgy) script, as well as the excellent direction (check for example the
long shot near the end) makes for a very good watch.

It would have been nice if the villainous behavior of one of the
characters was explained, or the ending not leave me speculating.
