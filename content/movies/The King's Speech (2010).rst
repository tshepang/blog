========================

Geoffrey Rush, who plays the speech therapist, gives an amazing
performance. He always delivers good performances, but this was perhaps
his best ever. The moment he was sitting on the kings' chair was
wonderfully humorous.

Colin Firth, who plays the title character, did very well too. I don't
remember enjoying any of his other work, and this is probably the best
he's done yet too. He even got awards for it.

Helena Bonham Carter is always a pleasure to watch. Here she plays the
king's wife.

The production design is amazing.

The movie drags a bit, especially for the tiny story it tells.
