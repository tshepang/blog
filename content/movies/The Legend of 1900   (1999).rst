The Legend of 1900 (1999)
=========================

Pretty much enjoyable, with good dialogue, and a fun performance from
1900's stepfather, and a lovely love interest, but what an oddball kind
of story? It's like some sort of fantasy, and has a weird and
unconvincing competitor, and it's as if the faster you can play piano,
the superior you are considered to be. It's a pointless story, and I
don't know why anyone who write it. Such a strange thing.
