The Life of David Gale (2003)
=============================

A very well-made political drama focused on the issue of death penalty.
Full of good performances, my favorite being the lawyer of the title character.
I have, for a long time,  considered it a masterpiece,
which was perhaps careless,
considering that I don't remember watching it more than once.
A revisit wasn't quite as impactful, but the movie remains impressive.
The last twist is okay, but maybe needless
(and earned the movie dislike from many). A better twist happens
earlier in the movie.

The punishment that David Gale goes through, after cheating on his wife
and beeing falsely accused of rape, is rather too much, especially when
refused access to his child. It reminds me of the injustice suffered by
the ever-drunk lead character found in `Crazy Heart`_ at the hand of his
lover.
