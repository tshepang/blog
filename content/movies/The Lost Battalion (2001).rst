The Lost Battalion (2001)
=========================

The story is not interesting enough for this to be a cinema movie,
that's why it went straight to tv. I hate watching a movie which makes
me impatient when it's going to end. The interesting moments are too few
to make if worth a watch. One notion worth mentioning though is the idea
of sacrifice, that one high-ranking officer knowingly sacrificed an
unusual number of soldiers for the 'greater' good. It's not clear what
the standpoint of the movie is, but I suspect the writer leaned more
towards the brutality being worth it.

[**sidenote**] It would be interesting to know why attaching knives on
rifles stopped becoming fashionable.
