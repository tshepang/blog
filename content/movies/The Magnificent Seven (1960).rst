The Magnificent Seven (1960)
============================

I find the effort to remake `Seven Samurai`_ into a western, The
Magnificent Seven unworthy, most especially because the original was so
formidable that it makes the remake laughable or disgusting actually â€”
compare the wise old man for example, or worse, the young wannabe
(played by the Toshiro Mifune in the original).
