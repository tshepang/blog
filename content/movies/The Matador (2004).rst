The Matador (2004)
==================

I seriously enjoyed this dark comedy first time I watched. This was due
to the highly enjoyable performances of Pierce Brosnan (the assassin)
and Greg Kinnear (the much nicer guy). The freshness of the story even
led me to place it among the best movies I watched that year. On second
viewing, it started off very well, but the Pierce character, though
still very good (my favorite of all his work), just gets tiring with his
repeated self-deprecating speeches ("I am a mess"). Also, at times, the
character lacks believability. I also found the ending not too
satisfactory, that this assassin character would pull off the last job
so easily.
