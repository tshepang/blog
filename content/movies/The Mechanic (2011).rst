The Mechanic (2011)
===================

Quality action is sadly complented by a cheap story (a guy from nowhere
all-of-a-sudden is superior to experienced bodyguards, and is being
trained for no good reason).

The giant gay hitman has quite a presence, reminding me of the great
`John Carroll Lynch`_. Equally impressive is the fat guy playing a
self-proclaimed messiah. Both these characters were surprisingly
weel-developed.
