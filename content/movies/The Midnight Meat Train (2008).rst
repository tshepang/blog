The Midnight Meat Train (2008)
==============================

After watching what felt like a waste of time, I was surprised to find
that `there were those who found it decent`_. The villain is given a
laughably bad performance by `Vinnie Jones`_. I don't remember any of
his work any good.

Some parts of the movie are decent:

-  the intrigue the lead character goes through as he unravels the
   mystery that is the serial killer
-  the lady our lead character tries to impress with his art
