The Ministers (2009)
====================

An especially shocking first scene got me excited, and whatever happened
afterwards didn't justify it's magnificence. It has some really good
direction (very dark with high suspense; wonderful romance), acting, and
dialogue, but the ending is shiite. There was a need for a bigger
budget, as evidenced by the less-than-adequate production design. There
was also a need for a better plot; the story about the burning building
is just not enough, and the great jealousy of scarface is just juvenile.
