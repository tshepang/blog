The New World (2005)
====================

I've since watched Disney's *Pocahontas* over a decade ago and remember
it leaving quite an impression, and it does deserve a revisit, even
though I'm pretty sure it won't match the tremendously superb re-telling
in *The New World*. That's a movie in which we are blessed with amazing
story-telling, aided by amazing editing, costume design, and
characterisation (the immeasurably-rich native behavioral customs which
probably exceeds that of the `Apocalypto`_; the struggling white
inhabitants and especially the kids).

The gal playing *Pocahontas* must have been quite a search, given that
she's so perfect and gorgeous and all that shit. Collin Farrell, who
helped me undermine the movie on first appearance, does manage to pull
quite a decent performance too.

I only realised this was Pocahontas when shown on the end-credits.
Yeah, I watched the movie almost by accident.
That it is romance made me worry, since it's hard to find good ones.
It doesn't disappoint in that department,
and the courtship moments are just about unbeatable. It's like paradise.
