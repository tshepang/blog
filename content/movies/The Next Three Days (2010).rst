Superb direction ensures that we are kept on edge of seat for much of
the running length of the movie, and even the slow parts adds to the
suspense. The lead detective is quite impressive, and I also enjoyed the
portrayal of the father of protagonist, as well as the wife of
protagonist, who also happens to be so damn gorgeous.

The movie opens with wonderful dialog, and the rest of the movie more
than lives up to the high standards that scene sets.

Special mention should go to the guy at the airport checkpoint. The
performance is amazing, though shortlived. It is the best such role I
have seen yet.
