The Notebook (2004)
===================

If found the largest part of the movie unbearably bad, and the very
uninteresting performances of the two leads didn't help. The movie
attempts to be a great romance, but there's nothing fresh nor is there
anything really interesting. Also, it's mostly a period movie, but none
of the costumes impress, and the production design is even worse,
reminiscent of made-for-tv stuff.
