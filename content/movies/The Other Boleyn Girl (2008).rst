The Other Boleyn Girl (2008)
============================

I don't remember enjoying any of Eric Bana's performances until now; two
of American's great sweethearts are here (the ridiculously desirable
Scarlett Johanssen and the sophisticated and disturbing Natalie
Portman). The are other good performances, and none is better than that
of `Anne Torrent`_ who plays the queen's first wife.

The movie starts off as yet-another English period drama (though I liked
the detailed look at the lives of the rich and pwoerful at the time),
but the intensity of the events at the end almost led me to call it
overall excellent.
