The Passion of the Christ (2004)
================================

Not much of a story, and all could have fit inside an hour, but the
makers decided to drag it on and on, with a fanatical lust for
showcasing extreme brutality. I found it to be a very good movie first
time I watched, but a revisit proves to damn unbearable. There way too
much screen presence of mother+prostitute duo; the conception of Satan
is both needless and badly done. It's bad direction, and it makes me
wonder what the fuck Mel Gibson (director) was thinking. Maybe this is
his form of (expensive) masturbation, given that he's a Christian and
all, so he maybe wasn't thinking straight, perhaps obsessed of showing
just how much the lord suffered for us.
