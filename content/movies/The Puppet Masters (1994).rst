=========================

Its concept of mind-controlling parasites is quite interesting, but its
action is not. I watched this forgettable movie a while ago (10+
years?). None of the acting is any good, but at least they got a real
gorgeous gal. The character design of the creatures is quite good, and I
especially like how they shape themselves when transported, before
spreading out their bodies.
