I was surprised to find that this movie was made by the legendary
Francis Ford Coppola. It's not quite big and famous either, perhaps due
to its lukewarm story and direction. I'm however glad that it has these
nice elements:

-  The enjoyable performance of Danny Glover, who plays the judge in the
   case. I don't recall enjoying any other of his performances.
-  The movie's best performance is that of Jon Voigt, who plays the
   defence lawyer. None of his other performances are as good or as
   enjoyable, but my memory has been proven unreliable.

[**sidenote**] I watched this only cuz I read the book (the version
condensed by Readers' Digest).
