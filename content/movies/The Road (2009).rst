It is better than the annoying `*The Book of Eli*`_, but not as
interesting. The portrayal of the post-apocalyptic world is as grim as
it gets, and seems far more realistic than *Eli* and *I Am Legend*. The
danger they face, where people kill and/or eat each other for survival,
gives an edge to the movie as well.
