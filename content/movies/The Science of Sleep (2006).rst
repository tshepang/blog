The Science of Sleep (2006)
===========================

Much like the first experience I had with *Underground*, I found this
unbearably irritating. This is due to the bizarre storyline and
directing, as well as an eccentric/insane lead character.

The desirable gals, especially the main love interest (played by
Charlotte Gainsbourg), makes it survivable. The romantic drama involving
her almost makes the movie worthwhile, and her performance is
amazing/flawless. The gal playing the friend is a lot prettier though,
while the one playing the colleague isn't bad either.
