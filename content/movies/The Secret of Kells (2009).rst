The Secret of Kells (2009)
==========================

It's bizarre in a way similar to *The Triples of Belleville* and has
some emotionally powerful moments.

Highlights:

-  the attack scene was quite painful; it's some of sort of reminder of
   the tough realities of the world
-  the character development of Ashley, the forest creature that helped
   the hero on a few occasions, was quite interesting; it was especially
   sad when her great strength was challenged by some evil creature of
   the same forest, especially when her form changed to express the pain
-  the general character design/development is quite good really; my
   favorites are the strict leader of the town and the fat guy
-  the cat is among the most charming characters I've seen in movie
   history

On the negative side, the movie is a little disturbing/unsettling (okay,
that's not a negative), and is also sleep-inducing. I also couldn't get
what the point of it was. Maybe it's kinda biblical, since it centers
around some all-important book (and the lead character looks like Jesus
when grown-up).
