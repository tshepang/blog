The Sixth Sense (1999)
======================

A rather tired supernatural thriller about a boy tormented by ghosts and
a psychologist trying to help him. There isn't much of a story, so the
director over-stretches it, resulting overly-long and boring moments.
The boy's mom is given the movie's best performance.
