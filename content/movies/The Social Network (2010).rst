The Social Network (2010)
=========================

The *Social Network* is a fun ride, and is unlike anything done before
it. Calling it a masterpiece would however be a lot more than it
deserves. Sure it was made by the best director ever, it has the
supercool Justin Timberlake, has a superb lead, and has quality acting,
incredible camerawork, an amazing script/dialog, but that is just not
enough. Perhaps it was just not gripping enough, or the story appealing
enough. It ends decently, though not in any way one would expect, and
maybe mere *decent* is the problem.
