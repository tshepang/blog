**pros**:

-   Much better than [its remake].
-   An extra-gorgeous/desirable daughter.
-   Much better lead performance, though not quite award-worthy.
-   Good stunt work (the speeding car; the fall down the stairs).

**cons**:

-   Suffers from lack of explanation for the villain\'s deeds, as was
    its remake..
-   Not fun enough\... sleep-inducing.
