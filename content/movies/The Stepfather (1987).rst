=====================

**pros**:

-  Much better than `its remake`_.
-  An extra-gorgeous/desirable daughter.
-  Much better lead performance, though not quite award-worthy.
-  Good stunt work (the speeding car; the fall down the stairs).

**cons**:

-  Suffers from lack of explanation for the villain's deeds, as was its
   remake..
-  Not fun enough... sleep-inducing.
