=====================

**pros**

-  the first scene is classic
-  decent acting (my fave is hose salesperson)
-  pretty ladies (my fave is hose salesperson, and the son's girlfriend)
-  nice cinematography (the atmosphere fits the subject matter)

**cons**

-  just another murder thriller, adding nothing new to the genre, and
   with a shitty story; the writers just didn't know what to do with the
   killer


`The earlier movie`_ is much better.
