The Sunset Limited (2011)
=========================

This I watched merely for the sake of curiosity: the entire movie
takes place in a single room and has only two characters engaged in one
long conversation. They discuss a number of issues (god, suicide, jail,
bad deeds, friendship...). Samuel L. Jackson is as unsatisfying (and
noisy) as usual while Tommy Lee Jones should have done something more
fitting of his acting skills. It happens to be mainly noise about
nothing, and me wonders what the point is (life sucks?).
Beware of some really bad usage of sound effects.
