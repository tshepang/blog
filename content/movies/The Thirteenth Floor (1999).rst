The Thirteenth Floor (1999)
===========================

The movie is well-made, and has an exciting twist.
The eveil acts done by two of the characters needed better explanation,
most especially the first one (it was too sudden).
I enjoyed watching the detective... nice performance there.

The gorgeous gal is a lot more appealing when she's a cashier,
as was the case with Amy Smart as cashier in `The Butterfly Effect`_,
another movie which tackled the alternative reality concept.
