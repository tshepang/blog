The Triplets of Belleville (2003)
=================================

Here's what I wrote some years ago:

    Totally unlike anything I've seen before, an extraordinary animated
    feature, with some superb music, magnificent characters, and amazing
    stylistic choices, and supreme storytelling... It's an awesome
    experience, pity it runs for less than 80 minutes. It carries
    greater emotional impact than most movies I've seen.

That still stands except the last sentence, since the revisit brought no
such impact. Let me add that the movie is a bizarre ride (no dialog,
unseeming super-tough heroes, etc.) and that the highlight of the
wonderful music is the one track at start of the end-credits. I also
remember enjoying the raunchy opening sequence much more than on this
revisit.
