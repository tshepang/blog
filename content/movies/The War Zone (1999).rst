The War Zone (1999)
===================

The female leads, the mother (Tilda Swinton) and the daughter, are given
amazing, flawless performances. That mother is also given superb
character development, and so is the son, whose unenchanted mood and the
painful events he sees around his family fit very well with the ugly
camerawork and shit weather. The captivating subject matter (the
seldom-covered one of incest) keeps the movie edgy, even though the
dialog and the pace are kept to a minimum. The direction style makes the
whole thing feel realistic, and the focus on the boy made it feel like
you really are in his shoes, while the complexity of his character (he
was neither hero nor villain) made the movie all the more better.

I found it sad that the two female characters outside the family were
thrown away without explanation, though they too were given good
performances.
