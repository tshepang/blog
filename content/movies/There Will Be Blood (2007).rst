There Will Be Blood (2007)
==========================

Here is how I felt on first viewing:

    Before Daniel-Day Lewis' oil driller in *There Will Be Blood*, I
    don't remember any other character in movie history as ruthless as
    Al Pacino's in `Scarface`_; Lewis' however is tougher, darker, and
    even better-developed, rendering Pacino's seem a mere maniac. None
    of the other performances has any noticeable flaw either and the
    movie starts like a masterpiece (the first few moments of silence
    showcases top-class direction, the characters are amazing, etc.)
    and, though it never lowers to the level of common fare, doesn't
    quite reach the pinnacle. The end leaves one wishing there could be
    more to the story, perhaps a bit of color to an otherwise painful
    movie (there's not a single ray of light, bar the barely-explored
    romance of the lead's son). Interestingly, the entire work isn't as
    depressing as the story suggests, but rather more of an adventure,
    as well as a unique and powerful exploration of mining life, not to
    mention a graphical depiction of the dangers it entails.

On a revisit, I take back the claim that Lewis' character is actually
tougher than Pacino's. The rest of the review is still accurate though.

I would like to add that the cast is among the best I have seen yet in
movies. In addition to the magnificent Lewis:

-  `Paul Dano`_ gives an incredible performance, one that is so good me
   wonders if he can ever equal it.

-  `Dillon Frasier`_ gives among the most impressive child performances
   ever. It is all the more impressive that this was his first
   performance.

The movie could have done well with a different ending though, for the
one it has is a bit over-the-top, even though not pointless. This is not
to say it is not well-made of course, for it is in fact among the
best-made of all in the movie.
