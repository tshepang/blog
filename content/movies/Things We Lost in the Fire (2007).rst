Halle Barry does a similar character she played in *Monster's Ball*,
only this time there appears a lot more close-up shots which exposes her
not-to-impressive acting talent (and overrated prettiness). The movie
itself feels a little pretentious, not least of which is the character
of Benicio Del Toro, who plays a guy suffering from drug addiction.
