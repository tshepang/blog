Thor (2011)
===========

Certainly doesn't live up to the hype. Some parts of the shallow story
are embarrassing, and the humor recycled. The visual effects are meh,
and I did not like the costume design of the Asgards. Their city has a
nice design though, though the look feels like excess.

At least, the title character is gorgeous as fuck. I also like the
concept of the mysterious gatekeeper, and the character. The silver
robot is also interesting. I enjoyed the movie more on a revisit.
