Total Recall (2012)
===================

The movie is so different from the first same-titled such that it cannot
really be called a remake. It is not quite as interesting, for the lead
actors are not as interesting (there is no Schwarzenegger or Sharon
Stone), does not take place in Mars (sadly) and is a straight-forward
thriller without any mind-fuck qualities the first one had. The action
was really overlong, and had the too-many hero-luck moments, making it
nearly unbearable towards the end.

Some nice technology ideas I have not seen before:

-  necklace that allows one to change appearance; by the way, the guy
   the protagonist turns into, gives a nice performance
-  transport the goes through center of the planet straight to the other
   side
-  small video cameras that attach themselves to surfaces, shot through
   a gun

And some I have seen:

-  levitating cars (a few movies)
-  a machine that gives one convincing but fake memories (the first
   *Total Recall*)
