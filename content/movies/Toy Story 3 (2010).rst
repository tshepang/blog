Toy Story 3 (2010)
==================

This is the best *Toy Story* movie, and the only one I truly enjoyed.
The toys go through some elaborate adventures, ending up in some
seemingly hopeless situations, but luckily ending up surviving one way
or another. And the ending is as happy as can be. The environment, as
presented by the leader of the childcare toys, is so-gorgeous and
so-enchanting. The baby villain is quite scary, and the main villain is
unforgivably evil. My favorite characters are Rexx (the sweet dinosaur)
and the female cowboy (with her retarded voice). The clown, who makes a
first appearance here, is the best-designed character in the whole
series.

**update**: A revisit was by far less enjoyable, but some moments remain
interesting (the Spanish mode), some charming ones (check the college
age toy owner with the toddler) and some great visuals (check the trash
sequence).
