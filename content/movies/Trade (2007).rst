The pretty brother of the gal who gets kidnapped for sex should have
been given less screen time. Either that or more acting classes. Same
applies to his sister, the victim, though to a greater extent. I wonder
if Kevin Kline took the role because his career isn't doing so good, or
because of the subject matter (one would hope for the latter). I wonder
what's up with the guy driving the victims to their fates. He represents
a failed attempt at a portrayal of a bad guy with some good inside of
him, but is given a real poor performance. In conclusion, I really think
the director is bad, and should not have been allowed to head a movie
that carries such an important message.
