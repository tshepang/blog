Training Day (2001)
===================

It's a fairly interesting story of a rookie cop being driven around by
an experienced one, but it appears more a Denzel Washington "my acting
skillz rock" show than anything else. There is a visible attempt at
building something really good and exciting, but it's somehow just
lacking. It's intetesting enough to watch it to the end without it
feeling unbearable, but it just feels like it drags, telling a story
whose purpose appears non-existent.

They should also have chosen a more interesting actor than Ethan Hawke.
I enjoyed Macy Gray's bit performance even though it was overdone. Dr.
Dre should have been excluded or taken more acting lessons.
