Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)
=====================================

I didn't see any improvement in visual effects over the previous movie.
The story is shit too, but the gal excessively gorgeous, much more so
than the previous overrated (and overrated) Megan Fox. Beyond
money-making, there can't have been a reason this movie was made,
especially since it doesn't add anything. The action is as frantic and
hard-to-follow as in the predecessors, with an annoying tendency of
having the humans tougher than would be realisitc (check how much
they're thrown around, only to stand and continue fighting). Very little
of the humor is effective, my favorite being the part where the lead
assaults own car.
