first review (2009)
-------------------

Of course the 2nd *Transformers* movie is going to have superior visual
effects to its `predecessor`_ but nothing more groundbreaking. You
oughta love the destruction of the aircraft carrier though. And the same
complaint I had with the first one is that there's way too much going on
as regards the action such that I can't keep up.

It appears I wasn't the only one who loved the human hero's parents as
evidenced by their far greater screen presence, and they don't misstep
here too. But they don't help advance the story, which is non-existent
anyways.

I don't remember anything believable, and at the end of it ya feel like
*what a waste!*, but then the entire concept of the Transformers is
pre-juvenile anyways!

second review (2010)
--------------------

A revisit of *The Transformers 2* was an unpleasant experience. It makes
apparent the farce/silliness the entire concept actually is. I am
especially annoyed by the impossible survival our heroes have, and worse
still, none of the members of the military are any interesting. It's
nearly unbearable and just too noisy. It's as bad as the first.
