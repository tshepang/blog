Tron: Legacy (2010)
===================

Bizarre sci-fi taking place mostly in a computer system, about an
exciting wish for one computer program to escape into the real world.
There's interesting artefacts, like a small rod that transforms into a
vehicle at will, while the simulation of Jeff Bridge's face is
disappointing, especiallly considering the great work done to Brad
Pitt's face in `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button`_, which was
released in 2008. The imagery is very (too) stylish. None of the
performances are worthy of praise (did they have to cast Olivia
Wilde!?).
