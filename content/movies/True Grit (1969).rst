Quality direction can successfully mask an okay storyline. As evidence
of that, this sucky movie has a `a far better movie`_ based on that same
story. And it's not like that much-younger movie takes advantage of
superior visuals of anything like that.

I also do not get the appeal of John Wayne; why did anyone thinks he's
any interesting.
