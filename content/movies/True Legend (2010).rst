True Legend (2010)
==================

Real nice opening credits visuals, some interesting martial arts, and a
weird thing where the main story ends way before the end of the movie.
It's like the makers were honest enough to realise that they didn't have
much material, and decided to start another subplot involving some
Russian fighters challenge our hero. As is usual with these martial arts
Chinese movies, the white foreigners receive some seriously shallow
character development, and happen to be evil, and unconvincingly so.

The lead character is done poorly by Vincent Zhao, the same guy who
spoiled *Once Upon A Time In China* series by replacing Jet Li in the
4th and 5th movies in the series. I don't remember enjoying any of his
other performances.
