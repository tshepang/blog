Tsotsi (2005)
=============

The lead character has got talent (I've seen him on stage), but either
he's just not good enough for this role or the director just didn't push
hard enough. Also, I suspect that the movie would come off better was I
unfamiliar with the language used... if you ask any ordinary black South
African, it's quite unconvincing.

First time I watched this, I was hoping that it would match the
excellent SA township tv series, Yizi Yizo, and it failed dismally. It
was still hard-hitting and skillfully portrays some of the poor township
realities of the country, but it turned more towards some sort of
morality play. I guess it's a matter of taste, but it should at least
have been convincing.

highlights:

-  the camerawork and the sets; I remember the music sounding superior
   the first time I saw the movie
-  the comic performance by one `Kenneth Nkosi`_, who plays the dumb,
   yes-man gang member
-  the scene regarding title characters's childhood was quite good,
   complete with excellent performances from the young boy and his
   father
-  nice performance by Zola, who runs an operation where he strips and
   re-sells stolen car parts
