It has a similar feel to *Taken* and is also set in dark Europe and
stars the very capable Liam Neeson. The storyline is solid and so is the
acting. There is a lack of gloss, and it's very edgy. The twist is
pretty good and so is the action, although it's not kool when you see an
untrained person suddenly capable of driving a car like a stuntman.
Writers this good could have come up with something better.
