Vanilla Sky (2001)
==================

How do I review this? It's a little weird and it makes me wonder why it
was made. There's an interesting character in the form of an ugly
attorney, but it's not a very fresh character. Penelope Cruz is also
interesting, but her character is also stale. Cameron Diaz's is the best
character in the movie and some of her moments are quite painful and hit
a bit too close to home (check the complaint regarding lack of
commitment from her lover). She plays the role quite well too. The twist
is unexciting and the brain-teasing happenings not thrilling.
