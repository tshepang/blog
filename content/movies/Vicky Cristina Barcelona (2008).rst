Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008)
===============================

This is one of those strange movies that I enjoy heavily on first
viewing and fall bad on a second one. For example, I found the character
of Javier Bardem incredibly appealing, but saw a cheap and pretentious
character second time around, as if the overly self-conscious Woody
Allen was desperate to appease. As for Pen√©lope Cruz, I praised her
profusely for her portrayal of the crazy-but-gifted ex-lover. Well, the
performance is good, but the appeal wore off, but it remains `my
favorite of her performances`_. I guess the main appeal of the movie is
the concept of open relationships (and frank sex talk), hence the
mention in `my discussion of the topic`_.
