Waist Deep (2006)
=================

A fun ride, following a former gangster trying to collect enough ransom
money to get son back. I'm not happy with the lead performance and the
pretty sidekick (so damn kissable!), but the rest of the cast is pretty
good, and the lead villain especially fearsome, though far less so than
on the first viewing. The ending is shitty and the police are too stupid
to be belieavable. The direction is quite good. It's strange why the
movie wasn't so popular in the Black community, especially since it's in
the same level of the far-more-popular *Set It Off*.
