Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010)
======================================

:tags: 2011-movie, substandard



pros

-  production design; check the home of the father (Michael Douglas) and
   the office of the billionaire (Josh Brolin)
-  cinematography; the best moments are near the end
-  Susan Sarandon is both beautiful and lovely

cons

-  feels like a desperate attempt to live off the shine of the 80's
   (overrated) original
-  the slow pacing and stale direction made me go "when does it end?"
-  the story is stale
-  the lead actor is miscast, and exposes his lack of talent
