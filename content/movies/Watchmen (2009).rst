Watchmen (2009)
===============

Watchmen is bizarre in a delightful manner, though it has annoying black
spots all over the place. One major one is everything about the
too-powerful shining guy (Mr Manhattan), and another is the bad old-age
make-up, so bad it may be deliberate.

The bright spots make up for this:

-  the performance of The Comedian, especially the moment when he kills
   a pregnant lady, pregnant with his child
-  the equally affective one where the disguised face is exposed

There is a lot of brutality in the movie, including the supposedly-nice
protagonists breaking bones needlessly. The scene itself, where they get
attacked by some oriental guys, is stupid. Either that, or it is some
sort of parody, as is the case with the War Room thing, parodying a
(great) satire, `Dr. Strangelove`_).

This is one werid movie that I just don't know how to place, so will
leave it here.
