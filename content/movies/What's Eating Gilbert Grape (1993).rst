Answer involves 2 challenges:

* Living with a close relative suffering from extreme obesity.
* Living with another close relative, suffering from mental retardation.

This makes the movie important, even though it's not especially good.
The romance, or rather the gal (the sort of character that is Juliette
Lewis' now-dated trademark), is not interesting,
and most everything else that happens (e.g. the cheating wife episode)
just feels random and needless.

I did however like Crispin Glover's performance and I wish he was given
more screen time.
