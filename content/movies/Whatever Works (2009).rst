Whatever Works (2009)
=====================

Its being very feel-good is ironic, given that its main character is as
pessimistic a guy as it gets, insulting people everywhere and getting
away with it (reminding of Gregory House from the series, *House*).
There's interesting acting, and I really like the part where the
characters look at the camera, perplexed at what they are supposed to
see.

Fresh as it feels, the movie really smacks of laziness. Woody Allen is a
talented movie maker, but he didn't really put much effort here, or at
least it doesn't feel like it. The movie feels like a glorified sitcom,
and it's fantasy-like, with quirky happenings here and there, and
doesn't feel like one solid whole. This isn't what I want from theatre.
