Where the Wild Things Are (2009)
================================

Bizarre movie with creatures, designed to look like dolls, done in bad
taste. Those creatures are however as realistic as it gets, and the
story tends to be spooky in places (e.g. one of them asks the
near-victim if he'd be good dinner).
Catherine Keener, who plays the mother of the lead character,
is as impressive as always.
