White Men Can't Jump (1992)
===========================

It's about basketball, romantic relationships, and money, and it's not
ambitious about it. It's got some interesting performances here and
there, the best of which take place in the court. But it also got some
substandard ones, especially the lovers of the lead characters
especially. The direction is a little weird, and it appears the actors a
lot of freedom, and some scenes feel over-extended. Check especially an
early one, where the two leads meet for the first time.
