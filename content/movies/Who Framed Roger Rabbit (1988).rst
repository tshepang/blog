Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)
==============================

A mostly uninteresting and irritating mixture of 2D animation and live
action, which luckily has an ultra-sexy wife of the title character. No
one else is interesting, unless you want to mention the brief appearance
of the pig "that's all folks" and Bugs Bunny. The movie is also badly
directed and acted, and it's strange considering that the director is
Robert Zemeckis. Maybe the producers (the money people) got in the way.
