Chronicles the suffering and thoughts of an intellectual giant during an
intense cancer treatment that lasts several months.
The performance of Emma Thompson is incredible, and the best she ever gave.
The movie feels quite fresh, and is somewhat experimental...
Emma's character constantly interjecting movie events by talking
directly at the camera.
