Wrath of the Titans (2012)
==========================

:tags: 2012-movie, decent



The visual effects are decent, the performance of Liam Neeson (Zeus) a
lot better than in `the previous movie`_, the performance of Ralph
Fiennes a lot less menacing (and less interesting), and the movie itself
less exciting. The new character of the son of Poseidon is interesting;
Andromeda, the queen of the human army, is given a miscast and
uninteresting performance by Rosamund Pike,
