A highly-enjoyable fantasy about a bad-guy video game character who
yearns for some loving. His acting on this desire, however, messes
things up since he was designed to be villain. Along the way, he meets a
delightful character in a form of computer glitch, an outcast that he
reluctantly befriends.

The whole thing is typical Disney, but it\'s all good formula. The
animation is good (check the racing cars and the high-resolution game)
and the story enchanting, and it\'s all predictable of course.
