Watching the first half of the movie, I saw a *Se7en* (urban decay and
the brutal violence on some of its citizens; the tough cops
investigating; oh, and the glorious ending). Yeah, it was quite intense,
with a different touch of a lower budget and less glitzy style, but very
effective. This was helped by an amazing cast, all well until the guy
playing the informant shows his shortcomings near the end. Wonderful
setup and script, until an unsatisfying (and unjustified) ending. The
horrid deeds are unjustified too, and the movie doesn't offer the
intense emotional impact when the credits roll. You see, movie endings
are extremely important, because if they are shitty, they really mess
the glory that may have already been presented. I didn't care much for
the resonation with *Saw* movies, for the story didn't need it. This is
a movie that should have risen above that level.
