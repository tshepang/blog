X-Men (2000)
============

As a kid, I was big fan of X-Men. That is why it was such a
disappointment to watch this movie (about a decade ago). I was hoping
for impressive effects and interesting characters, but instead got an
uninteresting Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and too much of a focus on the
Anna Paquin character, Rogue. I remember been saddened by Halle Berry's
performance, perhaps because I was not a fan, but also because I was
also a fan of the character she plays, Storm, and she just didn't do a
good job. There decent performances by the old men playing the leaders
of the opposing factions, Xavier and Magneto. But even then, it was
business-as-usual for them, so nothing ground-breaking.
