X-Men 2 (2003)

I remember loving the first scene, in which some teleporting character
manages to infiltrate the White House. That, by the way, is my most
favorite of characters in the movie, followed by the Oriental gorgeous
gal, the mutant with the same powers as Wolverine. It is a pity she dies
like that. I also loved Mystique, whose abilities are ridiculously
impressive. There are so many characters, and the movie handles them
really well, which reminds me pretty much of `The Avengers`_. Like that
movie, you don't feel like any character is left under-explored.

One other thing is the movie is by far better than `the original`_, and
in many ways. That is a strange fact, especially given it's the same
director responsible. It is easily the best of the X-Men movies.
