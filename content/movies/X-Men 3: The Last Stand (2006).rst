X-Men 3: The Last Stand (2006)
==============================

The worst in the trilogy, it makes one appreciate its [immediate
predecessor][] especially. It is also heavily populated with characters,
many new, but they are mostly shallow. Both the script and direction are
far poorer than one would hope. It is full of lame utterances and
uninteresting performances, all but from the super-fast lady, the
Aaliyah (dead RnB artist) looklike.
