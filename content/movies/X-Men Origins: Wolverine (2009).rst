X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)
===============================

The worst in the X-Men movies, it just feels like an excuse to milk the
brand. Fact that the production was troubled probably explains it. None
of the visual effects are any good, and the location of the final fight,
top of the cooling towers, was quite stupid... why did Wolverine go
there? Also, why did my favorite guy had to wear such a stupid and
unconvincing fat suit? Horrible!
