My favorite character is the super-fast mutant, and my favorite scene is
one where it stops security guards from killing his accomplices. The
humor is good and his abilities impressive. The time travel part wasn\'t
done bad and Wolverine is interesting. The Sentinels are fearsome and
the power of Magneto ridiculous, much like he had in [X-Men 3: The Last
Stand].

I see this received better reviews than any of the movies in the
franchise, but I think the [X-Men 2] was better.
