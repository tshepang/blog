X-Men: First Class (2011)
=========================

A decent attempt at telling the origins of Magneto and Xavier, their
meeting feels forced. It is good entertainment, but none of it is
outstanding at all. The visual effects aren't any groundbreaking as one
would hope from a spectacle such as this. The villain is not
interesting, and so are most characters, especially his followers, all
shallow as fuck.
