Year One (2009)
===============

A fun and lazily-written movie set in ancient mythical times; there's a
number of hilarious moments and fun characters, my favorite of which are
Caine (first biblical murderer) and the high priest. Sadly, the fun
isn't very consistent (hence the work 'lazy'), but it's enough to keep
one interested. The most hilarious moments ought to be the one involving
foreskins.
