Yellow Earth (1984)
===================

A harrowing tale of a woman yearning for freedom in poor and rural
China. It is a very meditative work, more powerful than `Raise the Red
Lantern`_, and full of raw emotion (check especialy the guy who plays
the father, the movie's strongest actor) and simple in terms of
storytelling. It also showcases the side of China I never really saw so
vividly displayed, the musical side. The movie is touching to the point
of tears.

Amidst all the pain is at least one hilarious moment which involves
bed-wetting.
