Multiple satisfying lead performances, favorites being the blind man and
the cross-dresser; highly engaging and oft-touching story with good
humour; beautiful fight scenes, albeit not as romanticised as your Yuen
Woo-Ping sort; comic usage of musical beats (and check out the last
dance); excellent twist(s).

There's an obvious Kirosawa inspiration, less the silly gangsters.
Another worthy element is that such movies transports one to a very
foreign culture, which is a real nice break from Hollywood.

How lucky was I to experience this 'inaccessible' movie!
