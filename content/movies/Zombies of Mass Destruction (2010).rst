Zombies of Mass Destruction (2010)
==================================

**pros**

-  The movie is very well-done and has very interesting characters, most
   notably the ever-smiling candidate for mayor position.
-  The freshness of the direction and cinematography reminds me of the
   superior *Call Back*, the best horror I saw for the first time in
   2009.
-  It covers issues of homosexuality and xenophobia very well.

**cons**

-  The treatment of the zombie side of things is really shitty. Perhaps
   it's a lack of a budget, but it's done so bad, with bad make-up, and
   shitty horror movie happenings.
