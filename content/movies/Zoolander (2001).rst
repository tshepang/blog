Ben Stiller gives `the most interesting performance of his career`_, and
perhaps the only one I ever enjoyed, according to my unreliable memory.
Sadly, he gives the only interesting performance in the movie. Luckily,
the movie makes up for this with various hilarious moments, one favorite
being the playing-with-fire scene.
