best movie critic: Jonathan Rosenbaum
=====================================

:date: 2012-02-06



I don't remember how I bumped into Jonathan Rosenbaum but he turned out
to be best ever movie critic I've read. The grandeur of his reviews,
obtained through extensive film viewing, sheer love for the art form,
and superior expressiveness, is enough to compel one into patting him as
the best, regardless the fact that I rarely ever agree with him.
He provides inspiration, and his contributions push film criticism as a
respectable practice.
