good 'Dark Knight' review
=========================

:date: 2008-10-04



I just read `a real good Dark Knight review`_, which does a good job of
explaining the complex topic(s) the movie attempts as well as the superb
The Joker, in better words `than I could manage`_.

Perhaps equally good is `a hater review`_ from the same publication
which is even more quotable:

    This is a pulp experience that goes on and on and on, with the tired
    assumption that length connotes depth, and somber tones — and the
    occasional cackle — inject relevance and insight into an
    adolescent's approach to morality and ethics.

That quotable review by the way got comments which really deserves
checking out, and among my favorites:

    The thing that ruined the movie for me was all that impenetrable
    jingoistic bullshit about who was a hero and who needs a hero and
    what kind of hero, and who gives a shit? That and the bullshit about
    the noble people not blowing each other up. Both boats would have
    blown up at once with everybody diving for the trigger, yelling, "Me
    first! Fuck you!" Just like the Joker thought. What a lousy move for
    a great character to get stuck in.
