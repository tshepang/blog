I saw [300] yesterday with the comments turned on and noticed numerous
compositing errors. These are however not as ridiculous as those of *The
Matrix Revolutions*, which significantly lowers its visual effects
prowess, not to mention that the human-shaped robots weren\'t so
impressive either, even though they still pack a punch. The movie
remains less-than-average, though more bearable than the last time I
checked.

As for *300*, it would be unfair to judge the movie itself due to the
reduced dramatic impact caused by the comments (and Zack Snyder, the
director, decided to turn the entire thing into a one-man show instead
of giving the other filmmakers, who were with him during the commentary,
a chance).
