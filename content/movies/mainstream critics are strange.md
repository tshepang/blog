Following is my experiences of movies on the [Sight & Sound list] of the
10 greatest movies ever made:

I\'ve seen the overrated [Citizen Kane] and slept through the *2001: A
Space Odyssey*. I did not find anything particularly exceptional about
[Tokyo Story], and *The Searchers* does not deserve to be mentioned
(except maybe for the lead\'s surprising non-angelic persona, which
gives him some complexity). I did not notice a single thing special
about *Vertigo*, which made it more shocking given that the critics
regarded it the greatest movie ever made! It was even more perplexing to
find anyone honoring [Rashomon] at all. Of all those I\'ve seen, the
only one I actually like is [The Passion of Joan of Arc]
