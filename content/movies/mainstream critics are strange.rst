mainstream critics are strange
==============================

:date: 2013-03-25



My experiences of those I've seen from the `Sight & Sound list`_

I've seen the overrated *Citizen Kane* and slept through the *2001: A
Space Odyssey*. I can't believe *Singin' in the Rain* made it into the list,
nor did I find anything particularly exceptional about `Tokyo Story`_.
*The Searchers* does not deserve to be mentioned
(except maybe for the lead's surprising non-angelic persona,
which gives him some complexity) nor does *Vertigo* because I did not
notice a single thing special about it, which made it more shocking given
that the critics regarded it the greatest movie ever made!
It was even more perplexing to find anyone honoring Rashomon_ at all.
