I don't remember any movie based in India quite as rich and vivid as
*Slumdog Millionaire*, a painful and seemingly pointless exercise which
happens to be India's answer to the far superior *City of God*.
[**update**: a revisit didn't prove very favourable, tempting me to
replace 'far' with 'once']

It was a pleasant surprise to find Darren Aronofsky helming *The
Wrestler*, a small but solid, yet-another-fallen-sportsman-story with an
amazing cast and a very strong Mickey Rourke, whose character is in such
pain that death ought to be better. And this movie appears the most
conventional of Aronofsky's (think of the mesmerising *Pi* or the
heart-wrenching `Requiem for A Dream`_).

On a lighter note, we got the most enchanting *Wall-E*, a touching story
of undefeatable love which got a strange quality of very quick
story-telling, and not a dull moment. It's superior even to its awesome
predecessor, *Robots*. It's on the league of *Monsters, Inc.*, *The
Incredibles*, and *Ratatouille* on their heydey.

I was delighted by the light-hearted *Zack & Miri Make A Porno* until it
insulted me with shitty-ass, formulaic, romantic comedy bullshit towards
the end.

Numerous Adam Sandler comedies have showcased him as a laid-back and
tough guy, but none with the flair of *You Don't Mess With the Zohan*, a
weird and exciting fantasy/satire regarding middle-Eastern peoples. The
only comparably-excellent movie Adam has been in is *Punch-Drunk Love*.
