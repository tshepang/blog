more of Jia
===========

:date: 2009-12-22



Jia Xhag-ke's Xiao Wu is nearly as dull as his Platform, but rescued by
it's shorter running time and sprinkled with some joy in a form of the
romance that transpires, a romance that helps one sympathize with the
otherwise annoyingly-boring and cold title character. A more observant
critic saw far `more than I did`_.

The World is quite a gem: the romance is heartfelt (Jia is real good on
that subject, as he proved in Xiao Wu), and the friendship between the
Chinese and Russian sweet. Jia is also capable of having me cringe at
the ridiculousness/mediocrity of humanity since the title of the movie
actually refers to the theme park of various world landmarks, EG a
smaller replica of The Eiffel Tower, and, worse even, people taking
themselves photos in front of the fakes.
