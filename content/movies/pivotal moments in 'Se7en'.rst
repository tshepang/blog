pivotal moments in 'Se7en'
==========================

:date: 2008-02-19



The following are among the moments which let me respect it so hard:

-  An early scene where an uninterested detective questions Somerset's
   (Morgan Freeman) investigative depth regarding a murder not committed
   by John Doe, where there's blood splattered on the dirty window. The
   memory of this moment, complete with its sombre atmosphere, incite
   the sort of excitement that is only reserved for when I'm love,
   romantic or otherwise. I wish I had a better way of explaining why I
   love that scene that much...
-  A later scene where some police officer (Brad Pitt) is withstanding
   heavy rain near a murder scene while waiting for the detective
   Somerset. The atmosphere here helps too, as is the seeming dedication
   of the officer to the job.
-  The moment where the detectives are called in by a uniformed officer
   into a noisy club, guiding them to a murdered prostitute. This scene
   portrays well the difficulty of police work, having to withstand the
   club's noise. I also loved the alarmed look of the mentioned
   uniformed officer, which helps us feel just how intensely horrific
   the prostitute's death was.

There should be other moments which should reveal themselves with a
revisit (I've since seen the movie over a year ago). [`update`_]

**sidenote**: I suspect that the scene in *Fight Club*, a movie that's
superior due to its visceral appeal and a more complex and
groundbreaking story, where the guys go on the basement of some club,
does pay a homage to that of the prostitute murder in *Se7en*, which
also takes place in some basement.
