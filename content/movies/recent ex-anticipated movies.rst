recent ex-anticipated movies
============================

:date: 2009-07-01



Farewell My Concubine was the most memorable of those Chen Kaige/Zhang
Yimou movies that I had for so long wanted to watch (until this year)
and therefore was supposed to be luminous, but turns out to be an
overlong, boring and pointless piece of shit. It does however partly
exposes the unsettling horrors of China's Cultural Revolution. I
strongly suspect that the exposure it got was to due to the then-brave
touch of homosexuality.

Even worse and less interesting is what the great `Jonathan Rosenbaum`__
felt to be the best mainland Chinese movie ever, Platform.
It turned out to lack any interesting characters and story. It's a
fucking mystery that anyone liked (or made) it.
