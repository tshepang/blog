========================

I don't remember seeing vampires as well-realised as in *30 Days of
Night*, and the heroic and suicidal scene, where a secondary character
saves the lead's life (for the second time actually), is tough to beat.

Taraji Hanson won `2007 performance of the year`_ and repeats her sass
in *Talk To Me* in a much bigger role, though not with as much impact,
though remaining impressive still.
