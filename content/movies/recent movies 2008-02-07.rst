The strange thing about the *Three Colours* trilogy is that it feels the
films are made by different directors, even though they all carry the
same themes of individuals made unhappy due to love, making one feel
glad not existing in the character's lives. Another common element is
the presence of strong secondary characters; in the case of `Three
Colours Blue`_, the first and best, we get a strip dancer, in the case
of *Three Colours White*, the least interesting, we get a well-off
stranger who meets the protagonist on a train station, and in the case
of *Three Colours Red*, we get a lonely retired judge who is perhaps
given greater presence than all the others.

This trilogy of tragic stories is a little overrated because, though
good movies, they are pretty much like experimental portrayals, the sort
that would attract minimal audience interest.

*The Curse of the Golden flower* is Zhang Yimou's worst movie I've seen
yet, for , besides being really boring, also happens to have a whole
bunch of bad (the three brothers) and unbearable (Gong Li) performances
and a shitty-ass and very unsatisfying storyline, leaving me wondering
what the point was. The visuals were overdone, leaving the movie looking
cartoonish. Luckily we had a wonderful performance by the gorgeous ninja
lady (whose identity I'm lazy to find).
