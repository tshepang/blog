Stanley Tucci is wonderful in *The Devil Wears Prada*, a movie which
also got the honor of perhaps being the first movie that showed me the
workings of the fashion industry, a foreign world to me.

*Magnolia* `isn't really a good movie`_, but is much better than
*Crash*, which got the same theme of multiple characters involved in
very strange and random circumstances, though the latter also gets
loud-mouthed about the whole racism issue, which don't work if not
handled well.

*The King* is the best of this bunch even though the ending don't seem
well-justified, and is left unexplained, and I wish there should have
been a better lead, while William Hurt provides a really good
performance. By the way, this it happens to be the first movie I've
seen that touches on Intelligent Design.
