The presence of the two leads, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, made my
watching *The Lake House* accidental, and what I would have missed is an
enjoyable and laid-back romance whose star is its wonderful play on the
concept of time, all this while refraining from shitty-ass formula
typical of Hollywood romance.

The history and origin of the *Jumper*'s jumpers would have been fun,
but instead some seemingly hurried producers/editors decided to reduce
it to mere passing mention; I could have done with a better villain,
fearsome as Jackson was.
