*Kaena: The Prophecy* has an obvious influence on `Beowulf`_ regarding
the visual design of the arch-villain and its environment. It got its
breath-taking moments but is largely boring and feels over-long at a
mere 90-minutes (it feels like a TV series).

*Running Scared*, flashy as it is, remains a sort of wannabe *Lucky
Number Slevin* was, but without fooling its audience. It also has its
moments.

The confrontation between Craig Bierko's and Russel Crowe's characters
is fun to watch in *Cinderella Man*. For some reason, I expected it to
be a challenging movie, but it's actually just another,
edge-of-your-seat sports movie. At least it made me feel lucky that I
wasn't in the US during the Great Depression.
