I find the effort to remake `Seven Samurai`_ into a western, *The
Magnificent Seven* unworthy, most especially because the original was so
formidable that it makes the remake laughable or disgusting actually â€”
compare the wise old man for example, or worse, the young wannabe
(played by the Toshiro Mifune in the original).

I found *The Brave One* highly entertaining, and superbly-made, complete
with wonderful sound and a great lead performance by Jodie Foster; I
would have benefited from a better title, and it could have done without
the friendship between the vigilante and the cop, which results in some
unfortunate sugar-coating, detracting from the movie's tough approach.
