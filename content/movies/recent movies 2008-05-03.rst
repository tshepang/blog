It's hard to believe that some people are still interested in the Diana
story, but I found *The Queen* to possess exquisite camerawork and
production design, the elements that the boring *Possession* possesses.
Luckily, I had the pleasure of seeing *Iron Man*, which is a superb
crowd-pleaser. And I really love the design of the metal suit.
