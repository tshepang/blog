Basic Instinct has nothing of value to say and there's no way the
scriptwriter thought she did a good job, unless something got really
fucked during production. It's even worse than the rather entertaining
and overly passive Are We There Yet, if for no reason but those charming
kids.

There's much to celebrate in 2 Weeks' Notice, perhaps the first movie in
which I enjoyed Sandra Bullock's peformance. It actually a pretty smart
movie, among the few romantic comedies I enjoyed, but, as could be
expected from such fare, a really fucked-up and overly-common ending.

The best of this bunch happens to be Hairspray, a carefully-made
anti-prejudice movie, perhaps the most enchanting movie that ever
attempted such a subject. Special note goes to John Travolta who gives
the movie's most delightful performance, despite also taking part in its
dullest moment, that in which she dances with the husband character
played by Christopher Walken, who himself is taking uninteresting roles
as time passes.
