Me being a big sucker for martial arts shows, especially when it gets as
exotic as having 2 near-invincible monks strutting their stuff in
ancient China, what can I do but marvel? Jackie Chan manages to remain
interesting (unlike in his other disgusting efforts) while Jet Li is
about as cool as ever, although the movie tends to be too childish and
playful, which spoils it all. The biggest fuck-up however is the
appearance of the American teenager, the same-old fuck-up that is so
common, where you only wanna see Orientals, \'cuz Caucasians just don\'t
fit in this sort of environment, making it feel cheap/fake; and despite
that this teenager don\'t have no previous experience, he still manages
to stand his own against supposedly-professional soldiers; I haven\'t
mentioned the lack of acting skill. I have here been talking of the
long-awaited Jet Li/Jackie Chan collaboration named The Forbidden
Kingdom. \[[update]\]

*Hard Candy* is intense with an edgy feel to it, and features 2
highly-dedicated performances, a well-written dialogue, and got the
earliest ever twist of any movie I\'ve seen.
