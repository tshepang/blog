John Leguizamo is among the most intense of actors (see *Summer of Sam*)
and it's really impressive that he's just as skilled in comedy too. I
remember his amazing turn appearance as a dwarf in *Moulin Rouge*, but
why I write about him is his performance in a childish fable,
*Honeymooners*, where he got no match, even though the movie's funniest
moment is Cedric the Entertainer's cayenne pepper moment, possibly the
year's funniest so far.

I don't quite know what to make of *Boiler Room*, except that it's
pretty exciting with powerful performances from Vin Diesel and
especially Ben Affleck, and an especially superb one from Tom Everett
Scott as company boss. The initial scene, displaying the excited
employees, is classic.

*Something New* is quite a delight really with gorgeous shots and an
unfortunately standard romantic movie moments (the break-up, the
get-back-together, and other shitty moments). Anyways, the story's about
a brain-damaged woman who gets healed by a perfect man. Some race issues
get raised and luckily aren't preached, even feeling fresh at that.
