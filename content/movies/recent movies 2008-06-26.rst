I pretty much enjoyed the popcorn biking movie, *Torque*, despite being
spoiled by its fantasy elements, more suited to a *`Final Fantasy
VII`_*. The level of fantasy should have a limit, depending on the
situation.

There's good acting from the two leads of *Vacancy*, a well-made horror
movie about sickos murdering motel visitors on camera.

*Shooter* was as exciting as I expected but was full of uncomfortable
formula; there aren't too many sniper movies out there but this is
probably the most effective; the movie is in the spirit of the *Bourne*
trilogy.

A revisit of *Robots* didn't do much to diminish the genious creativity
behind it.
