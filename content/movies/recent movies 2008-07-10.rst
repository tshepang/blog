There's a tremendous amount of fun to be had in *Kung Fu Panda*, a
superb crowd-pleaser with some of the greatest action I've seen of any
movie. The filmmakers' taste however varies from mine; I wouldn't have
chosen animals, some of which are simply a result of eccentricity, and
which I suspect to have been deliberate.

The *Incredible Hulk* has got a great fight between Hulk and 'an
abomination' and is far better than its shitty predecessor. The scenic
(and abused) views of the massive Latin American slums are memorable.
