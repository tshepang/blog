A really good drama can be found in the very engaging (and painful)
House of Sand and Fog, which also got Ben Kingsley providing quite a
performance. It also got beautiful camerawork and sets in places, and
beautiful women too.

Wild Hogs is a fine movie with a fresh storyline (though City Slickers
had a similar concept), but it appears its creators didn't really know
how to run with the story, specially with an ending that don't do it
justice; William H. Macy is pure bliss.

I was quite surprised that it was John Lequizamo playing the delightful
villain in Spawn, being the real center of the movie and is about its
only saviour. The guy really is talented and helps the movie get
bearable. It was perhaps 10 years back when I first watched, and even
was unsatisfied especially by Satan, and then by Martin Sheen as a very
miscast villain. It's a very bad movie.

One thing that attracted me to Closer is Mike Nichol's attachment as
director and he here crafts a movie of gorgeous sets and camerawork
armed with a fresh and original storyline, albeit depressing.
