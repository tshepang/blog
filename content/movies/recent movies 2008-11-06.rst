Smart dialog can be found in *The Squid & the Whale*, which portrays an
ordinary story of a troubled and divorcing family, complete with
gorgeous performances (except I would have preferred Anna Paquin's
absence). It's a strong character study, dominated by the harsh/cold,
naive, idiotic (yet beloved and intelligent) older son, trying too hard
to impress and support a shitty-ass asshole of a father, while all
that's wrong with the world is blamed on the mother. One wishes a good
number of families get to witness such beauty and introspect selves,
'cuz what the family goes through is serious crisis.

3:10 To Yuma was lesser than I expected while Jason Statham is the least
of the qualities of the beautifully-shot and exciting The Bank Job. At
the same time, there's way too much wizardry and dodgy martial atristry
in the disorganised mess that is Swordsman, and I discovered Kung Fu
Hustle's elastic master in there and he didn't help at all.
