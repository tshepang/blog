========================

:date: 2008-12-15



What I saw in *Step Up 2: The Streets* is among the best hip-hop dancing
I've seen yet, which brings it to the level of *Rize*. The movie is also
populated with a variety of interesting characters (bar some).

I was repeatedly fascinated by the short moment of the sexual
interaction between the black couple, not to mention the hotness of the
black girl, all in the old-fashioned actioner named *The Condemned*.

I was not going to mention *Mirrors*, but the ending alone makes it
worth a look. Make-up (or whatever it is that achieved the imagery of
the woman whose skin was melting) is top-class while the lady playing
wife just sucks, much more than the unconvincing 'first' victim.

A revisit of *Cloverfield* wasn't as much a let-down as that of `I Am
Legend`_ and am even tempted that it's so far the year's greatest
achievement in visual effects. I just want more of that fabulous
monster, and hopefully in a really good sequel. Perhaps an equally good
sequel would be another discovered tape, maybe with a bigger budget.
Here's me salivating on what could be an extremely satisfying franchise.
I just so much wish no one will fuck up the idea.
