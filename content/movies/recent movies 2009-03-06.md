Me wonders why The Watchowski Brothers decided to ignore the path of
decency (Bound, The Matrix) by doing an over-stylized (with bad taste
visual design) and childish Speed Racer. Almost neglected to mention an
annoying cast and bad directing.

Although Guy Ritchie\'s *Rock \'n Rolla* is quite a delight, it\'s not
quite up there with his *Snatch*; Although there\'s no match for Brad
Pitt, we got a nice title character player and actually a lot more other
players than its superior (Russian mafia head, his 2 tough guys, movie
lover, Gerard Butler, English lord\'s right-hand-man, \...)
