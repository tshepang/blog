Me wonders why The Watchowski Brothers decided to ignore the path of
decency (Bound, The Matrix) by doing an over-stylized (with bad taste
visual design) and childish Speed Racer. Almost neglected to mention an
annoying cast and bad directing.

*The Changeling* had great signs of a masterpiece, armed with impeccable
production and costume design as well as a powerful cast, superb
direction of a harrowing story, but this story was sadly spoiled and
over-lengthened by the serial killer thingy. Anjelina Jolie offers her
best performance yet; John Malkovich is working at convincing me that
he's among the finest actors alive.

Although Guy Ritchie's *Rock 'n Rolla* is quite a delight, it's not
quite up there with his *Snatch*; Although there's no match for Brad
Pitt, we got a nice title character player and actually a lot more other
players than its superior (Russian mafia head, his 2 tough guys, movie
lover, Gerard Butler, English lord's right-hand-man, ...)
