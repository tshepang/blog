Me don't quite know what to make of the well-made *Seven Pounds*, giving
one no clue what the whole thing is about 'till the end, while having
Woody Harrelson (perhaps) and Rosario Dawson giving their career best
appearances. And that suspense simply wasn't acceptable too, and I also
wonder what the story advocates... be good? And it's a very good movie
too.

I was not going to post a comment, but the gal in *Body of Lies* is
tremendously gorgeous and desirable, a central attraction in a real good
movie spoilt by an untalented lead.

Sean Penn is admirable for managing to transform self so well, away from
typical macho types he often plays, to a homosexual radical in *Milk*.
Among the finest actors surely, though he's done better before.

I had fun with Clint Eastwood's mild humour in an otherwise average
*Gran Torino*, while the much worse *Role Models* had a
surprisely-enjoyable 'final battle'. Even funnier is *Yes Man*, which
got a fresh concept but is fucked by common romantic comedy pitfalls.
