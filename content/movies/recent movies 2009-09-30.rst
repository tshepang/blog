Jia Zhangke's *Still Life* is surprisingly-good, partly because it's far
better than his tremendously-overrated `Platform`_. It has beautiful
camerawork and the story is handled with great skill, allowing one to
get lost in it, as if experiencing the pain of both poverty and lost
parental love with the characters. It's also blessed with a beloved
leading lady.

On a much lighter note is *Monsters vs. Aliens* which starts off like
sub-standard fare until the US president shows up, the prison warder,
and a whole bunch of other characters, adding serious comic punch. It's
however way too quirky, like no one involved wanted any awards.
