On a much lighter note, I found *Sponge Bob* surprisingly good, given
its bad taste crude animation style. Its humour and wit is top-class,
but it's forgettable at the same time, especially since I find myself
not remembering much, a day after watching it. It's unfortunately spoilt
by mixing it with some live-action.

*Ice Age 3* failed to live to the stellar expectations suggested by its
immediate predecessor, although I liked the otherwise overdone one-eyed
guide.

Chen Kaige's *The Promise* is nearly as annoyingly bad as his other
overly-depressing piece of shit, *The Emperor & the Assassin*. Strange
for a guy who excelled with `Yellow Earth`_.
