========================

:date: 2009-12-05



I don't remember a movie whose visual effects are of the scale of
*2012*, and only *King Kong*'s `are superior`_; The early scenes are
much fun, with nice superficial touches reminiscent of `Transformers`_;
The whole thing is dragged by some family drama as well as an
uninteresting John Cusack; Me loves the designs of the arks, and the
'chase' scenes, all an excuse to showcase the extravaganza that is the
effects, are pure fun. I nearly forgot to mention how much I like the
large Russian billionaire, an otherwise unconvincing buffoon that offers
much comic relief.

The first scene of *Inglourious Basterds* is top-class, for the
performance of the weary farmer when forced to make an unpleasant
choice, the sort where I feel self-death is better; Brad Pitt is quite
limited in terms of talent but not charisma; Quentin Tarantino is a
weirdo who possesses the freedom (perhaps too much) to paint whatever he
pleases on screen, and luckily got the talent.
