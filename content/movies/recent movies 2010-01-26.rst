I don't know what to make of the experimental *Waking Life*, which got a
helluva lot of seemingly needless philosophical babble, about a guy
failing to wake up; the twist is real fun.

I wasn't gonna mention the formulaic and stale *Confessions of A
Shopaholic*, but loved the funny scene where a group of shopaholics come
together to help cure their obsession; I also loved the flawless dummy
visual effects.
