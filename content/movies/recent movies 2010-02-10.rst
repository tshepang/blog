========================

I had intense anticipation for *Ninja Assassin*, and its intro lived up
to the expectation while the rest failed (the momentum is lost even
before halfway through); the brutality against the kids is hard to
swallow; also the supernatural powers are left unexplained & martial
choreography could be better; what I liked though is they helped wake up
the appealing mystery of Ninja lore, which will hopefully pave the way
for superior works.

*Kung Fu Panda*'s initial allure didn't survive a revisit â€” feels real
shallow and the martial arts not as impressive.

I can't dig deep enough in my memory to find a movie as lame as *Skin*,
a real-life drama set in apartheid South Africa; the editing disgusts,
leaving one suspecting that it was a rushed job.
