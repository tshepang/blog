There haven't been many characters as unpleasant and bitter as Marlon
Brando's asshole in *Last Tango in Paris*; I could not bear watching
this movie at one go because it really is depressing and sleep-inducing,
and happens to be way too eccentric (the subplot about the relationship
the documentrary director and the beloved gal).I checked out the buzz
and discovered that Pauline Kael, praised by many as the greatest ever
movie critic, `did fall for it`_. I just gotta go find time to read that
piece.
