Climaxed by the very last scene which is damn too hard to swallow, *The
Magdalene Sisters* is a horrid portrayal of young women forced into
slavery, in laundry facilities. I was praying while watching that the
entire thing is fictional, but it appears it's a true story, as
evidenced by the who-ended-up-where that is typical of such.

*Hunted*'s cinematography and production design make it look like some
made-for-tv fare; The first scene really sucks and the hand-to-hand
battling isn't as impressive as on `1st look`_.

There's a painful mini-twist in *Up In the Air*; Vera Farmiga, playing a
fuck buddy, is desirable while at the same time exuding maturity and
wisdom; the opening credits sequence is pretty good, and so is the
sound.
