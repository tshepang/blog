There is not a single performance (and I mean that) in *An Education*
that isn\'t top-class, but favorites are the girl\'s silent mom and the
glamorous blonde (such beauty!). The director also excels, but all this
hides the fact that the characters don\'t have real depth, especially
the girl\'s mom (door mat!), while the dad is not much more than a
caricature.

The fate of the man who got strapped with bombs got me bursting out in
tears in the not-so-typical war movie, *The Hurt Locker*. We also get a
whole lot of detail deliberately left out. I\'m left without knowing
whether to herald such soldiers as heroic or not.
