There is not a single performance (and I mean that) in *An Education*
that isn't top-class, but favorites are the girl's silent mom and the
glamorous blonde (such beauty!). The director also excels, but all this
hides the fact that the characters don't have real depth, especially the
girl's mom (door mat!), while the dad is not much more than a
caricature.

The fate of the man who got strapped with bombs got me bursting out in
tears in the not-so-typical war movie, *The Hurt Locker*. We also get a
whole lot of detail deliberately left out. I'm left without knowing
whether to herald such soldiers as heroic or not.

Nothing this year so far was as exciting as *Iron Man 2* (`newer
review`_), which was impressive not only due to great visual effects but
also good directing, script, and acting, and there's a nice cameo by
Samuel L. Jackson, a normally uninteresting guy whose only other work I
appreciate is `Pulp Fiction`_. The villain is a pleasure to watch.
