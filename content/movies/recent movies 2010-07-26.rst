There's a gem here and there in *Chicago*, but my favorite is the moment
where the lawyer's manipulation are portrayed by showing him as puppet
master (the puppets being the murderer and the press), and the song
accompanying that scene.

A revisit of *Law Abiding Citizen* left a bitter taste in mouth, and
none of the major performers helped. In fact, I was surprised by how bad
Gerard Butler was. I must have been blinded by my love for him in *300*.

There's gems here and there in the rather overrated *Annie Hall* (EG,
when the protagonist speaks to strangers, and part of his character when
he gets honest and straight-to-the-point). The movie however tends to
drag and seems pointless, more of a mental exercise and an exploration
of one clumsy, confused guy. By the way, this is the only movie so far
that I've ever enjoyed Diane Keaton's performance.

*Constantine* is still enjoyable due to the exotic story of its Satan
(who's portrayed so well) vs. God thing - the deals they made, the pawns
they created (angel Ghabriel is done so well, and so is the charming
demon; not to forget the half-headed not-so-charming ones in hell), the
worlds they created. The whole thing is also a reminder of the great
size of bull-crap that Abrahamic religions are.
