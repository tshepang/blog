*Death At the Funeral* got excellent set-design (check the furniture)
and good camerawork, spoilt by a story that exposes its rot
halfway-through and worsens near the end. On a political note, it's sad
that the movie perpetuates the idea that homosexuality as disgusting and
embarassing :-(

I was pleasantly surprised of the excellence that is *The A-Team*. It's
filled with superb and never-before-seen action, interesting characters
(my favorite is the smart, tough, and villainous gunman), and good
storyline. [`update`_]

*Knight & Day*, a half-serious secret agent story with a romantic touch,
is similar to *Mr. & Mrs Smith* (but not nearly as good). It's got nice
action and an uninteresting Tom Cruise, but Cameron Diaz is a
what-a-doll!
