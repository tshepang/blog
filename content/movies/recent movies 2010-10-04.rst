========================

:date: 2010-10-04



There's a bunch of people for whom acting seems like breathing. It seems
for them an excellent performance isn't much of a challenge. I'm talking
of people like Al Pacino, Gene Hackman, and in the case of *Wolfman*,
Anthony Hopkins. The movie itself is not so good (story not fresh; campy
visual effects) and I wonder why someone of Anthony's prestige would
take part in it.

*Iron Man*'s greatest blunder was always its shitty bald villain. None
of the other Middle-Eastern characters helped. What else was annoying is
that the arch-villain didn't even have practice to use the suit, but was
competent regardless. Otherwise, the movie is still quite a ride, and
that on a second revisit. I love its laid-back and humorous approach,
which makes it very fresh.

*Armored* is well-made, well-shot, and got Laurence Fishburne, and also
got a concept not before explored in my experience, but someone failed
to come up with a decent enough plot, or a justification for the
after-the-fact cruelty. It's a beautiful set-up that just got wasted.
Maybe the initial writer died, and someone was under pressure to get it
over with :-)
