========================

:date: 2010-11-30



Although there's nothing new, *Our Family Wedding* is such a delight,
and nearly all characters are beautiful, but most especially the 2
fathers (superb acting), and their childish exploits. The thing is
spoilt by some shitty comic touches here and there, especially the goat
thing.

I really enjoyed the highly-underrated *The Lottery Ticket*; it's very
well-made and funny, except it was rather too stagey with a miscast
performance of Ice Cube. Of special note was the guy playing Bow Wow's
friend. I could see the appeal the first moment he showed up on screen.
Look out for the scene on the roof where both the guys shine.

*Last Action Hero* is annoying partly because it uses the same movie
formula that it ridicules, though not as heavily as spoofs tend to. It's
also annoying because, amidst he noise, it has 2 superb villains, the
glass eye, and the child killer. I loved them back over a decade ago,
and still love them now, so much that I wish their characters (extremely
well done) could be exploited a little more, and in a better movie.
Slater's daughter is beloved.

I'm sucker for tough gals in movies (as opposed to those who act tough)
and one recent such character is Carrie-Anne Moss' FBI agent in
*Unthinkable*, a well-made movie spoilt by underdeveloped characters,
most notably Samuel L. Jackson's. And I love the ending. I actually
screamed excitement at the end.
