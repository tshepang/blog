*Amores Perros* is very rich, but also very disturbing and full of pain:
car accident, dog-fighting, trapped dog.

*American Psycho* is a bit similar to *Fight Club*: it's about a
financially sound guy who finds no meaning to life, and eventually goes
insane. The one difference is it's far less accomplished and feels as
purposeless as it's protagonist, but is entertaining enough to be worth
a revisit.

Although revisiting *Confessions of a Dangerous Mind* wasn't bad at all
(Drew Barrymore is desirable, George Clooney is interesting), it left me
feeling that I don't need to see it ever again: the half-serious story
is just too erratic.

Claiming a movie you didn't enjoy watching to be good is tough at times.
in my case, that's *Zodiac*. I wonder what the motivation of making it
was, but it at least boasts a superb performance by `John Carroll
Lynch`_, the highly-suspicious suspect. This `performance I honored last
time`_ wasn't fit for a revisit.
