The gal in *Hitman* is damn desirable, the movie so average (but I like
the early scene set in Africa). Here\'s an old review from early 2008,
and is still relevant:

*Ocean\'s 12* is still a great such a pleasure, as good as the first
viewing, and among the highlights is Bruce Willis playing himself.

The bespectacled villain in *Miami Vice* gives the movie\'s best
performance, and Gong Li, as ever, is a pain to watch because she
carries a face that is too sad to bear, even when she smiles. The movie
isn\'t as gritty as the first time I watched it, but I still like the
rescue scene, where the heroic officer expresses superiority.
