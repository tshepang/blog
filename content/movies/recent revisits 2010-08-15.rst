*Zatoichi* (`older review`_) has much boring drama (the geisha story was
especially hard to bear) and humour (the crazy boy), which was easy to
ignore first time around since I was seduced by the concept of a blind
swordsman. The action choreography is uneven (good at times) and I
enjoyed the final showdown and as well as the final dance sequence.

A revisit of *Good Night, And Good Luck* didn't pack as much of a punch
as before. It even felt barren.

The gal in *Hitman* is damn desirable, the movie so average (but I
like the early scene set in Africa). Here's an old review from early
2008, and is still relevant:

    Hitman's title character is too flawless to be believable but the
    characterisation and the decent performance makes the movie
    entertaining, barren as it is. The cop searching for our assassin
    gives the movie's best performance.

*Ocean's 12* is still a great such a pleasure, as good as the first
viewing, and among the highlights is Bruce Willis playing himself.

The bespectacled villain in *Miami Vice* gives the movie's best
performance, and Gong Li, as ever, is a pain to watch because she
carries a face that is too sad to bear, even when she smiles. The movie
isn't as gritty as the first time I watched it, but I still like the
rescue scene, where the heroic officer expresses superiority.
