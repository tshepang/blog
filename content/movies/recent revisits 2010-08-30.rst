`I Think I Love My Wife`_, `Dirty`_, & *Seven Pounds* are among those
movies that have a not-so-common property of being about as good on a
revisit as the first viewing.

There's hardly any other gal that has been given such a beloved
portrayal as Will Smith's sweetheart in *Seven Pounds*.

*I Think I Love My Wife* is well-made and got some of the hottest
collection of gals of all movies. It's a nice display of the challenge
of resisting temptation.
