revisiting 'Amadeus'
====================

:date: 2007-10-31



The highlight of the movie is the narrator (played so well by F. Murray
Abraham, supported by great dialogue) in this enjoyable drama about
obsession and jealousy, themes balanced very well considering that the
lead character hates the very man he admires, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
The praise this unfortunate character bestows upon Mozart's genius is
unheard of in my movie memory.

Unfortunately the fun ends right about the middle of the movie, turning
into a more sombre mood, partly because of (the beloved and
free-spirited) Mozart's deterioration into alcohol and partying, and
partly because the narrator featured less.
