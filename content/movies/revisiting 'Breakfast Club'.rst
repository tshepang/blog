revisiting 'Breakfast Club'
===========================

:date: 2009-10-20



I remember with great fondness what an impact *Breakfast Club* had on me
over 10 years ago. The characters are interesting, the dialogue decent,
and storyline still got a punch. It's about school kids in detention,
each interestingly an all too common movie formula — sportsman, prom
queen, punk, brainy, weirdo — and the movie is a good attempt at
exposing the problems each goes through as they get more than enough of
a chance to confide into each other. Oh, and Claire, prom queen
character, is a babe really.
