revisiting 'Die Hard'
=====================

:date: 2007-06-12



I was surprised that *Die Hard*, which I used to claim as a masterpiece,
is still engaging today, and that's rare for any other movie that ever
was a childhood favorite. It probably is among the most influential ever
action movies and seems to have invented a few cliches of its own, like
the punching of some annoying character at the end of a movie or the
silly and noisy police chief (no research done on these). There's loads
of good humor, some which is easily-missed (FBI having a laugh), and
some on the surface, like the amazing confidence those FBI agents
portray, not to mention the idiocy clearly shown by their silly faces.

My favorite characters haven't diminished their charm (the police who
repeatedly converses with the hero over CB radio, the limo driver, and
most notably, the computer cracker. Bruce Willis' shouldn't be left out
either for his amazing charisma.

This, together with the second sequel, *Die Hard With A Vengeance* as
well as *Predator*, made me honor John McTiernan (who directed them) as
the greatest action movie director ever, and that honor should probably
stay there for there haven't been much great action movies recently.
