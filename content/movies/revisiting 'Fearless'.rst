revisiting 'Fearless'
=====================

:date: 2007-05-25



It's with regret to mention that the battle I praised so hard
`previously`_ didn't look quite as impressive on second viewing. This
means *Fist of Legend* retains its title as having the best martial arts
choreography of all movies ever made. The movie's general appeal itself
also fell, meaning another revisit will be filled with reluctance.
