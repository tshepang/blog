revisiting 'Ghost Dog'
======================

:date: 2010-07-26



It's rare that one would enjoy a movie as well as first time. That's the
case with *Ghost Dog*, a movie devoid of any flashy imagery or decent
cinematography. The lead, the title character, is portrayed so well by
Forest Whitaker, and the movie is littered with what looks like
meaningless signatures (tragedy at the end, the idiocy of the villains,
the dog, RZA); the relationships Ghost Dog has with the French guy and
the young girl are beautiful, coloring what is otherwise a dark, dull,
and ugly world; the movie itself feels purposeless (if we don't count
its entertainment value). [`older review`_]
