revisiting 'I Am Legend'
========================

:date: 2008-12-08



[`older review`_]

*I Am Legend* was poised for 'movie of the year' until a revisit proved
it unworthy. Will Smith's daring acting (as in attempting expressions he
can't manage) doesn't cut it, and we would have loved a more complete
storyline. Not even the production design, which I once `heavily
praised`_, remained impressive still.

Emma Thompson, though appearing briefly, does offer the movie's most
electrifying performance. The Jodie Foster lookalike ain't bad either.
