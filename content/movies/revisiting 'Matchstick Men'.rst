revisiting 'Matchstick Men'
===========================

:date: 2008-02-17



A recent revisit of *Matchstick Men* was a let-down since I enjoyed it
much on the first viewing, especially given its heavy-weight twist, the
very twist that spoils a revisit. Nicolas Cage's retarded character lost
its appeal too.
