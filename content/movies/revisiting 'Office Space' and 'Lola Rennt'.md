It\'s interesting to note that, before revisiting these two, I
considered them masterpieces, which is [the oft-occurring case of being
over-impressed by first-time viewings][]: *Office Space* impressed me
due to its intelligent script (which is not so prevalent anymore) and
Lola Rennt impressed me due to its innovative storytelling (which does
not taste so fresh anymore).

John C. McGinley provides the only interesting performance of his I\'ve
yet seen in *Office Space*.
