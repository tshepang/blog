revisiting 'Office Space' and 'Lola Rennt'
==========================================

:date: 2007-06-22



It's interesting to note that, before revisiting these two, I considered
them masterpieces, which is `the oft-occurring case of being
over-impressed by first-time viewings`_: *Office Space* impressed me due
to its intelligent script (which is not so prevalent anymore) and Lola
Rennt impressed me due to its innovative storytelling (which does not
taste so fresh anymore).

John C. McGinley provides the only interesting performance of his I've
yet seen in *Office Space*.
