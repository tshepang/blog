revisiting 'Phenomenon' and 'Galaxy Quest'
==========================================

:date: 2007-06-21



I was years earlier excited by *Galaxy Quest* and still enjoyed it
through this second viewing, though I don't remember being this
irritated by characters who play the actors. The aliens are still
interesting, most especially the love-struck female one, and so is the
villain. Tim Allen was impressive in a scene in which he became ashamed
of self, and was interesting when having fun before realizing the
reality of the situation he is in. The visual effects are still okay,
most especially the vicious child-like creatures. The story idea remains
interesting too.

*Phenomenon* amazed me years earlier for having such an exciting idea,
yet staying away from its abuse by staging the story in a rural area,
staying away from the glitz it could have seen. The movie skillfully
portrays the sort of unrest resulting from a surprising turn of events,
but unfortunately reduces community members to idiots.
