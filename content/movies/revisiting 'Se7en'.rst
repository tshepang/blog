revisiting 'Se7en'
==================

:date: 2010-10-10



It would be dishonest of me to claim that my recent experience of
*Se7en* was that of a landmark, a label I've placed on it for years. It
felt more as an academic exercise, the kind that movie students would be
'forced' to consume, in order to make notes on various elements (and
there are many notable ones), a cold experience if you ask me (think
*Citizen Kane*, *Casablanca*, *Singin' in the Rain*, *2001: A Space
Odyssey*, ...). This is not to say it was as unpleasant as those
overrated movies, but I would also be dishonest to claim that I found it
anywhere as exciting as an *Iron Man* or a *Smokin' Aces* (both of which
I recently revisited).

**acting**

One minor gripe I've had with *Se7en* is that it lacks
superb acting. Morgan Freeman is as boring as usual with a standard
performance which isn't really better than Brad Pitt's. Kevin Spacey's,
although much better than the two, doesn't go anywhere near what he's
shown he's capable of. As for others, it mainly is nothing outstanding,
but Gwyneth Paltrow is without any noticeable flaw I have to admit.
There's two more gems: the detective inspecting the Gluttony victim and
receptionist from the club where the Lust victim was found.

**script**

One other gripe I've chewing on for a while is the
justification (or lack thereof) of the Envy victim. I also found the
scenes with Brad Pitt's beloved wife forced into the story (and boring
too), and a cheap manipulation used only to serve the ending. I also
never liked the chase scene, not due its execution (David Fincher is the
best movie director who ever lived, duh!), but because the movie isn't
escapist material (it's more a cerebral exercises, not the Die Hard
fantasy thrills). One other complaint is that the conversations seem
mere quick pepperings over some important philosophical issues. I do
understand that time is limited, but every time I watch the
all-important scene with John Doe sitting behind in a police car, I wish
the conversation would be longer. It was way too interesting to be kept
that short. Sure it's handled very well (excellent editing, and
camerawork), but the cops should really have been more curious.

**fall from glory**

Given all that negativity, I will tread
carefully and downgrade the movie from landmark level (leaving *Fight
Club* lonely) to masterpiece level... as if this was something
scientific. I will await another revisit before trashing it from these
high echelons of moviedom.

**it still rocks**

And given all that negativity, it doesn't mean
all's lost. The exploration of the murders is still quite fresh
(innovative), and Se7en remains the best detective/police movie I've
seen yet. The cinematography isn't bad, but the production design is
really top-class. The attention to detail is lovely, but I've seen
better.

**conclusion, and what's next**

*Se7en*, rich and well-crafted as
it is, has a rather shallow and small world. Nothing else exists. That
could be seen as a strength of course, for I suppose a great movie is
one that can really absorb you, allowing you to drown in its 'reality',
but I was left wanting regardless. Perhaps I was just hungry for a far
richer and complex world offered by a number of superb movies I have
been drowning in the last fews years. `The good things I once praised it
for`_ still stand though.
