revisiting 'Toy Story'
======================

:date: 2007-05-19



I saw *Toy Story* for the second time today since several years ago and
it hasn't really aged, except for the technology of course. I saw it
after *Monster's, Inc.* which I considered the best in 3D-animation for
a long time until now (story not so fresh; an irritating and formulaic
one-eyed character). So *Toy Story* remains victorious and got the honor
of being the first of its kind. It's even more enjoyable due to
providing code-names for Debian releases. The evil character, Sid, is
interesting to watch but my favorite is Rex for his innocent and
ever-smiling character.
