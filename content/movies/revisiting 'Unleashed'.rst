revisiting 'Unleashed'
======================

:date: 2007-06-11



Bob Hoskins is not convincing in his villain role nor is Jet Li who is
even worse, playing a lowly man-child; Morgan is miscast. Fight
choreography is decent but the only really outstanding thing is the
charming Kerry Condon playing the ever-smiling daughter. I last saw this
one last year when released and it feels worse the second time around.
