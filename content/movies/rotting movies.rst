rotting movies
==============

:date: 2007-06-07



I recently revisited *The Fifth Element* (which I honored for its
eye-candy) and *The Boondock Saints* (which I honored for its stylistic
action and Willem Dafoe) and it's a pity that the experience wasn't so
pleasant. Both actually emerged as bad movies for their shallow
storylines with all appeal gone, except that The Boondock Saints' Willem
Dafoe remaines interesting.
