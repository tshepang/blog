spoilt fun

*The Lookout* has got the year's worst fuck-up so far. How could one
provide a great script, cast and cinematography and then fuck it up with
B-grade action and a shitty ass ending? I also wonder what's up with a
completely unneeded broody guy in sunglasses, reminiscent of the equally
annoying guy in *Scarface*, the one that delivers the last shot onto the
Al Pacino character. Oh, and the pussy-shoving whore also simply
disappeared without an explanation. Something must have gone seriously
wrong during production.
