the dramatic Jim Carrey
=======================

:date: 2007-09-11



I recently watched The Number 23 (gorgeously shot, especially the
imagination scenes) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (very
original and disturbing) which led me to appreciate Jim Carrey's talent
as an actor who plays the lead in both (It was a second viewing for the
latter).

The Number 23 has better (excellent) direction but suffers later on as
the movie progresses from later drag as well as a lesser-than-superb
twist. It's also reminiscent of a superior Pi whose main theme is also
around a number.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the lesser of the two though
far more original. The movie's most notable moment the admin girl's
(Kirsten Dunst who at her finest) discovery (**SPOILER ALERT**) of
previous erasure for the same 'problem' she's currently having. Of
lesser impact is also the moment when that same girl states a quote in
which the movie's title is part.
