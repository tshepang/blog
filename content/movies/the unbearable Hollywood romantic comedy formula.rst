the unbearable Hollywood romantic comedy formula
================================================

:date: 2012-05-23



I don't mind formulas much, but I'm a little picky on which are
acceptable. The one I particularly hate is that adopted by too many
romantic comedies:

-  lover meets lover (okay so far)
-  lover does not tell lover something important (shit's about to
   happen)
-  lover finds out, and being more than a little sad, breaks up (I
   really hate this part because it soils the oft-cheerful mood; I hate
   also because it feels so fucking artificial and unrealistic, and
   makes some character look all uptight, unreasonable and/or
   unforgiving)
-  lover forgives lover (now that's real cheesy, and annoyingly
   predictable)

Now I seriously don't understand this formula thing. Maybe I'm too
stupid to realise it's what audiences like, that if they go watch a
movie in this genre, and find it doesn't follow the formula, they get
displeasure and the movie loses money. Fuck them if that's the case! It
pisses me off most especially because I tend to really enjoy some these
movies, and now I have to withstand this shit, just so I can get to the
good parts. So sad. I must get a life. Or I must just stay away from
Hollywood romantic comedies, and risk missing out on true gems.
