tough tale of poverty
=====================

:date: 2009-05-18



The backdrop of *The Story of Qiu Ju* is Chinese rural poor and the
story is of a strong-willed and simple-minded woman fighting with the
law to get a man who harmed her husband to apologize, nothing more and
nothing less (and it would be a spoiler to say which of the 2 she gets).
Gong Li, who plays the title character in this The Story of Qiu Ju is at
her best, and the direction is simple and raw. Oh, and the poverty and
suffering displayed is unsettling.

This story is more powerful than even `Yellow Earth`_, and with many
more strong actors, while the winter weather looks even more harsh.
