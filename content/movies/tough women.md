It\'s such a rare sight seeing tough gals in movies. When such
characters are developed and/or performed well, I always celebrate.

Here goes:

1.  Viola Davies as the mayor ([Law Abiding Citizen])
2.  Antje Traue as second-in-command of Zod ([Man of Steel])
3.  Julianne Moore as FBI agent (*Next*)
4.  Michael Hyatt as detective ([Nightcrawler])
