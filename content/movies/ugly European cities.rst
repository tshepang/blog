ugly European cities
====================

:date: 2008-02-17



I recently saw Ronin, whose non-glossy action reminds me of the 70's
action movies, and which is set in Europe, reminding me of the Bourne
trilogy. More notable is these movies show how ugly European cities are,
not to mention for example the police uniforms and police cars, perhaps
because I've been conditioned to the American look. And that Ronin ain't
so bad, but it's just not memorable.
