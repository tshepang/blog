unforgiving characters are annoying
===================================

:date: 2012-07-08



It is rather too common in passive movies where you would find a bunch
of characters whose quality of life is improved by a protagonist, but
when something goes wrong as a result of the work of that protagonist,
they get to be unforgiving/ungrateful to a point of public scorn or
physical violence. What makes this overly-common thing even more sad is
that such moments tend to spoil some decent quality movies.

Here are some examples:

-  `Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs`_
-  `Robot`_
-  `The Green Hornet`_
