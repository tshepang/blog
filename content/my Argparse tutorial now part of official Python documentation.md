I am very glad that [a tutorial] I started writing over 2 months ago has
finally been added to [the howto section] of CPython documentation. It
took a lot of iteration (over 7) in total before finally being accepted.
But even then, it\'s still not fully satisfactory for me, and I really
hope that someone else with fresh eyes is going to go through all of it
and offer improvements. Even better, I hope people will find it useful.
I know I would have when I started doing argument parsing. I found [the
main module documention] overwhelming, and [the very first example] is
in fact why I even started writing this tutorial at all, as is evident
on [the relevant issue].
