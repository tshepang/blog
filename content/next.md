A really well-made spectable, possessing high production standards,
as well as good acting from all participants,
especially Julianne Moore and Tory Kittles, the lead detective and her
sidekick. I just wish [Thomas Kretschmann] wasn't there. He's just not
interesting. At least not here.

There's great but brief visual effects, great cinematography, and
production design. And there's also the most romantic moment in movie
memory ("definition of beauty" scene which nearly soaked me in tears)
and the most painful moment so far this year ("explosive execution"
scene which nearly soaked me in tears, too). Such powerful emotions are
rare as are such movies.

I should not neglect to credit Nicolas Cage for leading the entire cast
without a flaw, and it's amazing that he still manages to maintain his
charisma after all these years.

One more thing is that *Next* seems to have been inspired by David
Fincher's *Se7en* (Fincher's sort of beautiful, dark and brownish
camerawork, and the scene in which cars are coming from underground
parking, short in a hectic pace as in to signify the urgency of their
mission, and the upward-moving end-credits).
