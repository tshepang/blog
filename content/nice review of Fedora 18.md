I really enjoyed reading [this review] of the experience of installing
Fedora 18 and first use. Other than being well-written, I like the fact
that he gives points to each pro and con. I also liked this bit of
opinion, which I totally agree with:

> Logging in. Being told there are updates. Holy crap -- 218 updates --
> for a release that's a day old. Does the word 'release' mean anything
> anymore? -5. Seriously, freeze that crap for a few days, only real
> security issues or facepalm bugs.
