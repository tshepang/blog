> In general you should avoid "we" and "you" when writing documentation.

> One principle to keep in mind is to only
> focus on the subject. If your documentation describes a component or
> process and does not involve a human, there's no reason for introducing
> this human there. If it explicitly aims at the human (e.g. instructions),
> of course it makes sense. But anything that can end up in a script does
> not require a human and should avoid we/you.
