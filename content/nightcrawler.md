The movie is overall well-made and got a story that feels fresh, and one
that's seldom told: people taking video footage of gruesome events. The
scene that culminates in a police car chase is intense and feels
realistic... great direction and camerawork.

Jake Gyllenhaal, the lead of the quality cast, is a highly skilled actor
(see [Prisoners] and [Zodiac]), but I haven't seen him this good. His
character is very unusual and scary, and pretty much a supreme asshole
you wish didn't exist. His life is shit (he's lonely, out of money,
and seems to have some mental problem), so I almost don't blame him for
his criminal behavior.

Rene Russo also gives a great performance, and so does the lady
portraying the detective, Michael Hyatt. The latter is very imposing,
and pretty much towers above everyone in her (few and short-lived)
scenes. [Great toughness portrayal] there.
