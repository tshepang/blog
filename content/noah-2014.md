I think there isn't much to the Noah story, so the writers added a few
things, like talking rocks, a magical grandfather (and pregnancy), a
pointless king (at least in the latter part of the movie), and a God
that sucks at communication. If I was tasked with creating a basic
story-line, I would have had the Noah family actually go find those
animals themselves instead of them magically be brought onto the ship.
In addition, I wouldn't do the lazy thing where they are all put to
sleep.

I was surprised (and disappointed) that the movie was directed by the
great Darren Aronofsky, who gave up [Pi] and [Requiem For A Dream].
There is nothing interesting/provocative enough to deserve such a
skillful person. The visual design may be interesting, but not by much.
It is dark and desolate, which is typical of his movies, but it's too
bland a story. It's epic, yes, but it's also based on one of the most
nonsensical of all stories in the Bible.
