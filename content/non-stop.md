Liam Neeson gets to be tough guy nearly as impressive as his character
in [Taken], and in a movie nearly as intense. More impressive, however,
is the [Nate Parker] performance, whose incredible transformation near
the end of the movie is exciting.

The movie has some of the best action sequences I've seen yet, as well
as impressive dialog and direction. The visuals are also wonderful
(check the descent of the plane as well as its landing).

I do, however, wish:

-   The acts of the villain were given better justification
-   More people should have died, given the rough landing
