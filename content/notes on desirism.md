Stuff I scribbled down after listening to the first Season of a
now-defunct [series on applied ethics], all an attempt to make sense of
it all:

-   morality:
    -   a subset of a theory of values
    -   it deals with:
        -   obligation
        -   prohibition
        -   permission
-   value: concerned with reasons for action
-   desires:
    -   the only reasons for action that exist
    -   all value is ultimately based on desires
-   all intentional actions are grounded on believes and desires
-   believes are motivationally inert
-   what good people do:
    -   promote desires that tend to fulfill other desires
    -   inhibit desires that tend to thwart other desires
-   what tools to use:
    -   use praise to promote good desires
    -   use condemnation to inhibit bad desires
-   there are two forms of desires:
    -   desires-as-means
    -   desires-as-ends (the type that actually matters)
-   shortcuts:
    -   the only desires relevant to the discussion are *malleable*
        desires
    -   the only actions relevant to the discussion are *intentional*
        actions
