There are not that many people I know personally who are angels, and one
of those died recently as a result of a car and truck collision. The
other occupants in the car, all three of them, did not survive either.
The tragedy is more notable because the guy, Yandisa Mfokazi, was among
my greatest friends ever. This is the guy whose family treated me like
royalty on a [recent visit].

Of all personal losses I have ever experienced, this is the greatest.
