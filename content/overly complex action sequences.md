I am a fan of action sequences in movies, but only if the complexity is
kept to some limit. Too often, A-class movies add a lot of complexity to
the mix, as if that equates to excellence, or increases chances of
selling more tickets. Here\'s examples from the most guilty:

1.  [The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn]
2.  [The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]
