-  Tshepang Lekhonkhobe
-  tshepang@gmail.com
-  Gauteng province, `South Africa`__

I do software development `for a living`__ and as a hobby
(examples__). My favorite ecosystem (and language) is that of
Python__, and my OS of choice is Debian__.

I watch perhaps too many movies__, and I `spend perhaps too much time
on the web`__. I also love music__, as well as engaging conversation.
