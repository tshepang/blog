If you want to replace some string in Emacs, the primary function to use
is **replace-string** (I think). If the strings, 'old' and 'new' are
provided, it will, by default, replace all occurrences, regardless of
case, while also preserving case of whatever 'old' was. It's magical
yes, but who doesn't like some magic once in a while, especially when
it's so convenient.
