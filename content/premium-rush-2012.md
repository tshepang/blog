Lots of exciting street shots, a very interesting (and immensely
desirable) female lead, some quality performances (the villainous
detective most especially), and nice production design. The movie did
not also need the political sob story involving some child. The two
instances of rivalry were done well: that between the lead and the
co-worker, and between him and the police bicycle rider. The action is
over-the-top, and downplays the dangers these bicycle riders impose on
others, and on themselves. It could have been just as exciting had it
been more realistic I think.
