[The announcement] by project lead, Jeff Atwood, sold me. This is one
rather incredible guy, a game changer of sorts, most notable for helping
create what is likely [the most important programming resource on the
web]. So whenever he goes and creates something else, I naturally do pay
attention, and this [Discourse] thing looks amazing, at least from by
limited usage so far.
