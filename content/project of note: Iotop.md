[Iotop] displays disk I/O usage of individual process, in a way similar
to top. What I really loved though is that it allows one to display the
accumulated amount of I/O on any of the DISK READ, DISK WRITE, SWAPIN,
and IO (overall). This is through a nifty interface:

-   You just press `a` on the keyboard, and it will sort the hungriest
    processes on top.
-   Reversing the order, you just press `r`.
-   If you want to sort by other colums, you just press the left/right
    key.

[The presentation] is rather busy, and it doesn't have the myriad
options that `top` has (e.g.Â I can't chose to hide any of the columns
I'm uninterested in), but it's more than good enough for it's
specific purpose.
