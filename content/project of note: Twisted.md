I\'ve been impressed by [the claims made for Twisted], which erased the
erroneous thought I\'ve been having that it\'s just another web
framework. Well, it appears it doesn\'t really have an equal, and is
something completely different.

What prompted me to award it **project of note** honor is its [patch
review process], a good indicator that this isn\'t a toy.
