[Mailman] is most likely the most popular mailing list manager in the
FLOSS ecosystem. What I like about it is the ease-of-use it provides for
the end-user: if u wanna subscribe to <topic@host.org> mailing list, you
simply append -request to the recipient name (<topic-request@host.org>)
and use the subject "subscribe", and simply send. To unsubscribe, you
do the same, except the subject becomes "unsubscribe". There's also
the web interface for those who won't remember/know these simple
instructions of course. Another bonus: it's written in Python!
