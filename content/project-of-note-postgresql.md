It is among those rather quite (in terms of controversy) but
highly-respectable projects. It also looks like no other FLOSS DBMS
system compares. It even bills itself *the most advanced open source
database* on [its main page].

I've had great respect for the project for years now, but what prompted
this post is its [2013-04-04 Security Release FAQ] ([via]), a
highly-detailed and thorough explanation of an important security issue
affecting a few of its releases. Reading this, one gets the idea that
it's some serious developers running the project, and I deeply
appreciate.
