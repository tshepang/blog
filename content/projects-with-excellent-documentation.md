Here is a list of projects whose documentation I found to be
highly-detailed and well-written.

big
===

-   The [introductory tutorial of GNU Emacs] (looks a lot better when
    run from within Emacs), is written in a very gentle and careful way;
    it's among the best tutorials I've seen. Same applies to [the
    Emacs manual], which I'm tempted to call the best I've read yet.
    It really, really goes into painstaking detail, and seems to have
    been written by professional technical writers.
-   [CPython] - this is quite massive, so although quality is generally
    high, it varies depending on where you are; [an example of
    excellence]
-   [sqlite3] - quite extensive, especially for an embeddable DBMS

small
=====

-   [Suds] - multiple, well-written examples
-   [rdiff-backup usage examples] - much smaller than the others listed
    here, but nevertheless deserves mention because it's both gentle
    and thorough
-   While working on giving a product of ours [at work] the ability to
    speak [SocketCAN], I really appreciated its [official
    documentation]. It is very well-written and thorough (though it
    assumes prior knowledge of working with Linux sockets).
