I had intense anticipation for *Ninja Assassin*, and its intro lived up
to the expectation while the rest failed (the momentum is lost even
before halfway through). The brutality against the kids is hard to
swallow. The supernatural powers are left unexplained & martial arts
choreography could be better. What I liked though is the movie helped
wake up the appealing mystery of Ninja lore, which will hopefully pave
the way for superior works.

I can\'t dig deep enough in my memory to find a movie as lame as *Skin*,
a real-life drama set in apartheid South Africa; the editing disgusts,
leaving one suspecting that it was a rushed job.
