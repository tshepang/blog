There's a gem here and there in *Chicago*, but my favorite is the
moment where the lawyer's manipulation are portrayed by showing him as
puppet master (the puppets being the murderer and the press), and the
song accompanying that scene.

There's gems here and there in the rather overrated *Annie Hall* (EG,
when the protagonist speaks to strangers, and part of his character when
he gets honest and straight-to-the-point). The movie however tends to
drag and seems pointless, more of a mental exercise and an exploration
of one clumsy, confused guy. By the way, this is the only movie so far
that I've ever enjoyed Diane Keaton's performance.

*Constantine* is still enjoyable due to the exotic story of its Satan
(who's portrayed so well) vs. God thing - the deals they made, the
pawns they created (angel Ghabriel is done so well, and so is the
charming demon; not to forget the half-headed not-so-charming ones in
hell), the worlds they created. The whole thing is also a reminder of
the great size of bull-crap that Abrahamic religions are.
