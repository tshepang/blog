[I Think I Love My Wife], [Dirty][I Think I Love My Wife], & *Seven
Pounds* are among those movies that have a not-so-common property of
being about as good on a revisit as the first viewing.

There's hardly any other gal that has been given such a beloved
portrayal as Will Smith's sweetheart in *Seven Pounds*.

*I Think I Love My Wife* is well-made and got some of the hottest
collection of gals of all movies. It's a nice display of the challenge
of resisting temptation.
