I don't remember seeing vampires as well-realised as in *30 Days of
Night*, and the heroic and suicidal scene, where a secondary character
saves the lead's life (for the second time actually), is tough to beat.

In _Talk To Me_,
Taraji Hanson repeats the sass she displayed in [Smokin' Aces],
but in a much bigger role, though not with as much impact.
