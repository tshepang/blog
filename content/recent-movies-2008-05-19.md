Basic Instinct has nothing of value to say and there's no way the
scriptwriter thought she did a good job, unless something got really
fucked during production. It's even worse than the rather entertaining
and overly passive Are We There Yet, if for no reason but those charming
kids.

There's much to celebrate in 2 Weeks' Notice, perhaps the first movie
in which I enjoyed Sandra Bullock's performance. It actually a pretty
smart movie, among the few romantic comedies I enjoyed, but, as could be
expected from such fare, a really fucked-up and overly-common ending.
