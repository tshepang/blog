I pretty much enjoyed the popcorn biking movie, *Torque*, despite being
spoiled by its fantasy elements, more suited to a *[Final Fantasy VII]*.
The level of fantasy should have a limit, depending on the situation.

There's good acting from the two leads of *Vacancy*, a well-made horror
movie about sickos murdering motel visitors on camera.

A revisit of *Robots* didn't do much to diminish the genious creativity
behind it.
