The best performer in *Raise the Red Lantern* is the lady who gave up
her career as an opera singer to get married to an uncaring rich man to
whom women are disposable mere objects. Even more painful is the
life-long servitude that many take, where they accept to be treated like
lesser humans. I do wonder what message the movie attempts to portray
though, and I also feel lucky I wasn't born in old China!

*Wanted* is nice, flashy, and as unaccomplished as I expected, but has
the most beautiful suicide scene in memory.
