Watching the bonus features on the DVD of *Pirates of the Caribbean 3:
At World's End* alerted me to the movie's major fuck-up, the absence
of a brand-new immortal crew. The first won because the skeletal crew
rocked hard, and the second won because of Davey Jones and crew. As for
this one, we are given the unexciting sea-storm as the star. By the way,
the first scene which [I once praised], doesn't pack quite as much a
punch as when I saw it first time around.
