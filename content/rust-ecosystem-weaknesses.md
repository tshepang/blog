These are problems Rust users face that have nothing to do with capabilities of the compiler,
but rather requiring work on libraries, tooling, and advocacy:

- iOS: Rust is not tier 1 on this major platform
  (installations number in the 100s of millions),
  which would help make it an important alternative to Swift and Objective-C
- Android: Rust is not tier 1 on this major platform
  (installations number in the billions),
  which would help make it an importatnt alternative to Kotlin and Java
