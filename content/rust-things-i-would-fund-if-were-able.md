My fantasy is having $1m for each of these,
in order of importance:

- [Helix], for it is my primary editor, and has [a lot that can be improved]
- [Pijul], for I want a better VCS than Git
- [Mustang] / [Eyra], for I want C off my dependencies
- [Theseus], for I want C off my kernel
  (and because it's the most exciting project written in Rust at the moment)
- [rustc_codegen_cranelift], for I want C++ off my tooling

[Pijul]: https://pijul.org
[Theseus]: https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus
[rustc_codegen_cranelift]: https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift
[Eyra]: https://github.com/sunfishcode/eyra
[Helix]: https://github.com/helix-editor/helix
[a lot that can be improved]: https://tshepang.github.io/enjoying-helix-part-3/
