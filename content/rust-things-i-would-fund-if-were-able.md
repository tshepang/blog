My fantasy is having $1m for each of these,
in order of importance:

- [Pijul], for I want a better VCS than Git
- [Mustang], for I want C off my dependencies
- [Theseus], for I want C off my kernel
  (and because it's the most exciting project written in Rust at the moment)
- [Zellij], for I want a more pleasant terminal multiplexer than tmux
- [rustc_codegen_cranelift], for I want C++ off my tooling
