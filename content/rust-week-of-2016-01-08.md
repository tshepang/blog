As usual, I [submitted] a [number] of [small] [doc] [changes]. I am
particularly proud of the code [submission] I made to rustdoc to strip
away the annoying whitespace appended before the final closing brace.

In other news, Rust by Example has [a very illustrative example]
regarding Box type and size of memory usage of data, and it led me to
submit [a tiny improvement].
