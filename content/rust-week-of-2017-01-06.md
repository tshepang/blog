I asked [two][] [questions] on Stack Overflow. The first led me to use
the nifty [lazy_static] macro for the first time, and the second led me to
submit [a complaint] (which got fixed within 3 minutes by the way).

---

I am looking forward to two projects:

-   [Alacritty], a fast terminal emulator
-   [Remacs], Emacs gradually implemented in Rust
