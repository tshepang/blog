I am tempted, [once again], to try out [Remacs], a Rust port of GNU
Emacs. It's very encouraging that it tries to be compatible, for the
drop-in-replacement effect.

I am glad [the change to add subcommands to structopt] has been merged.
It was the one important missing piece to [this wonderful project].
