Decent humor and an interesting lead make this watchable. There is good
anticipation of whether or not the guy under study is a lunatic. The old
girlfriend is desirable (as is the lead), and the carefree boss gets
sweet at times, even if he is cardboard character. Weird small movie.
Loved the ending. Romance was done okay, even if it is too typical of
romantic comedies.
