The main plot, that of an assassin softened by an innocent being, has
been done a number of times before. But the movie remains fresh. It's
clear that the writer is politically liberal, bordering on provocative.
Most notable is the sexual relationship between a young black guy (Cuba
Gooding, jnr.) and an elderly white lady (the beautiful Helen Mirren),
something I don't remember portrayed in movies before. As a sidenote,
it's probably these two roles that got them in later movies (*The Hit
List* and *[Red]*, respectively).

The movie pretty much weird, with the sort of direction I haven't seen
before. It didn't see much distribution, and I only watched it because
I deeply enjoyed the director's later work, *Precious*.
