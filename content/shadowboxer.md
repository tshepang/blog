The main plot, that of an assassin softened by an innocent being, has
been done a number of times before, but the movie remains fresh nevertheless.
One thing of note is the sexual relationship between a young black guy
and an elderly white lady,
something I don't remember portrayed in movies before.

The movie is pretty much weird, with the sort of direction I haven't seen
before. It didn't see much distribution, and I only watched it because
I deeply enjoyed the director's later work, *Precious*.
