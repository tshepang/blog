Episode 0 of Season 1, which was remade into Episode 1, got me excited
about the series. I loved the villain (superb performance), and it had
great humor (Dr.Â Watson character). None of the later Episodes could
match, all but the third (and last) of the third Season. The highlight
here is the villain, who ranks as the best in the series (Moriarty is
rather overdone). He represents great character development and is given
a flawless performance.

As a sidenote, of the series regulars, none of the characters was as
interesting as that of Sherlock's big brother. It's a superb
performance too, the character is such a joy (mature, wise,
influential), and he was made all the more interesting to later discover
that his intelligence matched that of Sherlock.
