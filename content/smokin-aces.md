This movie is intense and has so many gems spread all over it that I
ended up calling it a masterpiece at some point.

Some highlights:

- Taraji P. Hanson (I saw her first time here and was an instant fan)
- Taraji P. Hanson's rifle
- FBI poser getting information from security guy
- story concept (multiple pro-killers targeting one guy)
- the murderous neo-nazi trio

The movie is packed too much of goodness.
