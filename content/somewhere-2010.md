The lead character is rich, famous, and easily fucks ultra-hot women, yet
the only bright thing in his life seems to be her beloved daughter (who
is given a flawless portrayal). This feeling of purposelessness is
well-punctuated by Sofia Coppola's superb direction of loong takes and
a story where nearly nothing happens. I like the movie more than
the director's earlier *Lost in Translation*, which covered similar
territory, and the lead is far more interesting, and movie does not have that
irritating Japanese tv host.
