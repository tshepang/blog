Though engaging, it's not very exciting, but the leading guy, Jake
Gyllenhaal, gives a real nice performance. Check especially the moment
when he's told an uncomfortable fact. The villain is amazing too, and a
very unusual choice. The guy running the Source Code program is given an
embarassing and unconvincing performance.
