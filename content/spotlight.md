Great direction and editing work serve well this highly-entertaining story
about sexual abuses of Catholic priests. The characters are interesting
and impressively bold (see the new editor) and are given superb dialog.
Their commitment to the stories they tell is also admirable. What is sad
is that they are superior to the (admittedly competent) performances
they are offered.
