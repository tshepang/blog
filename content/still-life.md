The movie is surprisingly-good, partly because it's
far better than his tremendously-overrated [Platform]. It has beautiful
camerawork and the story is handled with great skill, allowing one to
get lost in it, as if experiencing the pain of both poverty and lost
parental love with the characters. It's also blessed with a beloved
leading lady.
