I feel like this is even worse than the 2002 movie, which I considered
the least interesting in the previous series of 3 movies. It was highly
disappointing because I heavily anticipated it (I'm a sucker for
super-hero movies). It is poorly written, and got cheesy romance and (I
wish Gwen died a lot earlier in the movie). It also has uninteresting
villains (Paul Giamatti is miscast, and so is Jamie Foxx). Not even the
visual effects impress, being worse than those of its predecessor [the
2012 movie], and the action is too frantic. I do like, however, the
relaxed manner to this Spider-Man. However, his skills are ridiculously
high, and he survives way too much current flowing through his body.
