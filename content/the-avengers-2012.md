I found [Thor] very unsatisfactory, the 2 recent Hulk movies very
lacking, and [Captain America] fairly bad. That's why I was concerned
when I heard that my favorite comic book hero, Iron Man, would be paired
with them into one movie. I was also concerned by the fact that Jon
Favreau was not directing. Luckily the movie turned out a lot better
than I expected.

So, what makes it so good:

-   The movie is directed in a similar style to those 2 Iron Man movies,
    including the clever humor and laid-back acting style.
-   The movie has some of the best visual effects I've seen yet, and
    about as large-scale as any of the 3 *Transformers* movies, without
    the overly-frantic action where you can't figure WTF is going on.
-   I found the reaction of the city public refreshingly-realistic:
    instead of watch and cheer the heroes, they run away from danger.
