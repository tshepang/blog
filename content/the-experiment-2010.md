Captivating but stupid and unexplained concept/story; decent
performances; lovely romance (complete with a desirable woman); the sound
effects are overdone.

[The original movie] makes this remake look better than it actually is;
but it's sadly more pretentious... feels more 'merely for show'; the
guys performing the experiment are even given godlike status, while
those in the original actually have faces.
