The two kids are a lot more interesting than the parents in this dark
comedy about a troublesome family that finds itself under witness
protection. It's well-made (and well-shot) but not very well-written.
The over-the-top violence imposed the each of the family members are
supposed to be funny, but fall flat, and I don't like how their cruelty
is downplayed.

I also feel Robert De Niro, the guy that gave [the best performance in
history], should have retired over a decade ago. He hasn't done
anything worthy of his skills, and is not interesting enough to keep me
interested. Or maybe he's just overrated, and incapable of doing
anything beyond his usual bad guy persona. He's boring, though the
movie isn't.
