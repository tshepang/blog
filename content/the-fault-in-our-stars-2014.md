The most exciting moment is the encounter with the author of the a
favorite book of the leading character. It was quite intense, and rather
surprising, though not entirely unpredictable. Willem Dafoe gives the
character some justice, even though the characterization feels recycled,
some sort of a caricature.

Besides that, this is yet another movie that starts off well and fucks
up later on. The fuck-up this time around happens around halfway through
the movie, which is around the end of the Amsterdam trip. The rest of it
drags on, and just feel overlong. I even got tired of watching the
leading lady, [Shailene Woodley], despite her excellent performance.
