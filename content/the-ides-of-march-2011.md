I expected a far more hard-hitting story, considering this is a modern
and high-end political drama. What I got was not interesting enough to
deserve going straight to cinema. It feels unfinished. Any random
episode of *The West Wing* is superior.

The gal is very wantable though, and the wife of the presidential
candidate (played by George Clooney) gives a decent performance, but is
denied screen appearance.
