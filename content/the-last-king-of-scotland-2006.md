The are three performances that stand out:

-   Forest Whitaker gives [the best one of his career] playing the title
    character. His is also a very well-developed character.
-   James McAvoy gives an excellent one as the advisor, though his
    character is not very fresh... tis been done before.
-   Kerry Washington is both a desirable and very capable actor, and
    there isn't a lack of those two qualities here.

The movie is very well-made, complete with quality production design and
an interesting story.
