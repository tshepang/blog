Here's [an article] that inspired me to watch this one. It's one of
those movies that make you lucky to live in today's South Africa,
because it shows abuses of human freedom in East Germany in the
mid-80's. The acting is pretty good, especially by the guy who is
taking part in the spying of the playwright. The very last moment is a
tearjecker.
