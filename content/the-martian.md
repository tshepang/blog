It's a rare experience for me to watch a movie after reading the novel
it's based on. There are so many comparisons, and those can result in
complaints. Anyways, this was a reasonably faithful adaptation, and also
very respectful one; there are many moments where things from the novel
occur briefly even though they don't really add to the story.

The one performance that I enjoyed, which happens to be superior to all
others, is that of [Benedict Wong]. He felt amazingly realistic, and was
presented a very loving and admirable character. No one else impressed
me, and that includes the acclaimed one of Matt Damon in the leading
role.
