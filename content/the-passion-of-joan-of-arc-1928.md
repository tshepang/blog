A well-made and entertaining dark comedy with interesting performances.
The lead performance also brought pleasure to eye, though it was never
quite convincing. The character is admirable though: she maintained
courage despite the mental torture (threats, harsh accusations, and
deception), though I wish she should have said more... too often she
kept quite while questioned. The direction is powerful, and so is the
story.
