It is better than the annoying [*The Book of Eli*], but not as
interesting. The portrayal of the post-apocalyptic world is as grim as
it gets, and seems far more realistic than *Eli* and [I Am Legend]. The
danger they face, where people kill and/or eat each other for survival,
gives an edge to the movie as well.
