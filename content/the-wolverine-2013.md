A lot better than [its predecessor], it is even more unusual in that it
doesn't feel like part of the *X-Men* franchise, both in terms of story
and direction. It starts off quite well, with decent family drama where
you wonder WTF's goin' on. It proceeds to some intense gritty action,
and some cheesy romance, and finally gets a not-so-exciting ending. It
left me wishing there were more mutants, for what we have here isn't
very interesting (the poison lady is curious, but she isn't very
interesting, and neither is her powers).

A few of the performances are interesting, most especially the gal with
the deformed face, though she's too much of a curiosity than an
essential character. The son of the dying man gets a commanding
performance, though the characterization is rather stale... done so
damn many times before. I am no fan of Hugh Jackman, but this one is his
best attempt at doing the title character so far. The design of the
giant samurai armor is amazing.

I wish the cinematography and production design felt less stagey, and
the sounds less retarded (e.g. metallic sounds emanate from swords
cutting through human flesh).
