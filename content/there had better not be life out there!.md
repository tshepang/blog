I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading [an essay] on why we better hope we
don\'t discover extra-terrestrial life. It\'s 8 pages of superb writing
and is pretty thorough (check how he explains the myriad possibilities,
and how he challenges even those), and nearly as exciting as the 1st
time I read Richard Feynman\'s \"[There\'s Plenty of Room At the
Bottom]\". I consider this essential reading for any enquiring mind.
