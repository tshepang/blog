An improvement over [the original], it has far superior visual effects
(the evil dark energy and the epic duels), a far more interesting
villain, and superior character design. Sadly, we are still stuck with
two very uninteresting characters: those played by Natalie Portman (the
stale love interest) and [Kat Dennings] (the unfunny comic relief).
