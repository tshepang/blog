It is one of those movies with a plot so complex that me got lost very
soon into it. It is also one of those movies that are so devoid of
excitement that it feels a bit like self-torture to watch to the end. It
didn't help that the very uninteresting Gary Oldman is the lead
character, though it helped that there was a performance as fabulous as
that of Colin Firth.
