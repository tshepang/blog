I hate it when characters that do not have supernatural powers survive
great pounding, being thrown against walls being the most popular form.
It cannot be too hard to avoid such situations as a writer, but it
remains common, which reduces the feeling of realism, and makes me sad.
Here's some examples:

-   The cave fall in [The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey] must be the
    most egregious I've seen yet.
