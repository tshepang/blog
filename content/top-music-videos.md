These are the best music videos I've seen yet (with a disclaimer that
the list is largely unmaintained). Excellence in the track concerned
contributes to the magnificence of its video... I'm a fan of nearly
all the corresponding tracks:

1.  [Next Movement] (The Roots)

    The odd positions that our stars take and the overall beauty of it
    makes it an eternal favourite of mine, not to mention fact that the
    track is among my hip-hop favourites. The simplicity of the video
    contributes and so is the fact it remains entertaining despite that
    it's shot in just one room, which is the kind of inventiveness I
    admire in art.

2.  [That Thing] (Lauryn Hill)

    Flawlessly merges the views of two eras on one screen.

3.  [Got Till It's Gone] (Janet Jackson)

    Great direction and cinematography as well as the casting makes this
    an eternal masterpiece.

4.  [Stranger in Moscow] (Michael Jackson; Director - Nick Brandt)

    Among the best camerawork and editing with magnificent slow-motion
    scenes.. towards perfection.

5.  [The Sixth Sense] (Common)

    Excellently capturing an unexplained event which looks like some
    sort of chaos, causing looks of despair and wonder among the
    characters concerned, some catching it on tv, some near the
    event... powerful.

6.  [Everything is Everything] (Lauryn Hill)

    Great VFX showcasing NYC as a turntable are hard to beat.

7.  [Hey Mama] (Black Eyed Peas)

    About as energetic as music videos get, it has great dance sequences
    and is very well-made, except the editing is just too frantic. There
    are a few highlights, but none beats the bridge section... nice use
    of retro visuals and more delicious dancing.

8.  [Respiration] (Mos Def & Talib Kweli feat. Common)

    Beautiful images of them great rappers strutting their style
    enhanced shot by the black and style camerawork with some wonderful
    busy city images.

9.  **Ebumnandini** (Doc Shebeleza)

    Few videos were aver able to capture the township party scene with
    such energy and believability. The cinematography is quite good too.

10. [Who We Be] (DMX)

    I usually like DMX's music videos because of their craftsmanship
    and the messages they portray -- staying away from the annoying
    booty-shows that so many successful other rappers employ. This one
    is armed with some excellent editing, some good visual effects, and
    some real-life footage all put in the mix.

11. [Love of My Life] (Erykah Badu)

    Erykah Badu's performance, as is the case in her videos, draws
    one's attention, despite a huge anti-climactic slow-down in the
    middle of the song.

12. [All 'n my Grill] (Missy Elliot)

    This could have been higher in the ratings had its mighty New York
    settings -- with the dark lighting and that famous yellow-taxi
    scenery -- not been interrupted by the boring dancing that Missy
    likes so much in her videos.

13. [Feel It Boy] (Beenie Man ft. Janet Jackson; Dir: Dave Meyers)

    Gorgeous, mellow, and digitally-manipulated environment which offers
    rare warmth. It boasts perhaps the largest collection of gorgeous
    women of any music video I've seen. Jackson doesn't look
    comfortable though, with unnatural poses.
