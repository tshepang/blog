6 months have passed since the [previous Tracker release] and it's real
great to have [another fresh one]. During development, its GUI interface
(TST) has went through two revamps, each being an improvement on the
previous one. This implies that those who have only ever used that
January's release have missed a TST which had categories (All Files,
Documents, Images, ...) which were presented as tabs, which shouldn't
matter anyways since the current interface, which uses a sidebar
instead, rocks like hell. Another highlight is the inclusion of
tracker-preferences UI which allows for easy configuration.
