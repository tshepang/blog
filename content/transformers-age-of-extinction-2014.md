It's the best in the series so far, but I don't really see an
improvement in visual effects over [its predecessor]. I'm guessing
that's because [the first movie in the series] set a ridiculously high
bar. In keeping to tradition, the movie is also noisy and has
overly-frantic action (WTF's going on), and has way too much of it. It
also has a shallow story-line and none of the characters are very
interesting. Luckily, there is no [Tyrese Gibson] and [Josh Duhamel] to
help spoil things. There is also no mention of why these primary human
characters were so drastically changed... sad.

The movie is entertaining throughout, despite running for over 150
minutes. The evil Transformers were scarily-violent, as they always were
in this series. The scariest of them, Megatron, was pretty much cast
aside in this movie.
