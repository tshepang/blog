It is rather too common in passive movies where you would find a bunch
of characters whose quality of life is improved by a protagonist, but
when something goes wrong as a result of the work of that protagonist,
they get to be unforgiving/ungrateful to a point of public scorn or
physical violence. What makes this overly-common thing even more sad is
that such moments tend to spoil some decent quality movies.

Here are some examples:

-   [Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs]
-   [Robot]
-   [The Green Hornet]
