Not sure, but I think this is [my proudest release yet] of wajig so far.
Among other things:

-   I cleaned up the Debian packaging with [some great help]. I promise
    that it was seriously ugly. I guess nobody was motivated enough to
    clean it up... including me.
-   I added a fresh help system, and cleaned up the documentation
    machinery while at it.
-   Increased the use of aptitude, where it makes sense.
-   Made some commands redundant by introducing better ones.
-   Some polishing (consistency fixes).
