The release of [wajig 2.3], though important to me, caused varius
complaints because it changed much of the UI. 2.5 goes a long way
towards fixing those. What particularly helped guide this release is my
creating a [mailing list], just so that I can ask users for opinions on
whether or not to do this or that change. There was much feedback and
complaints of course, sometimes to a point where I felt like I'm just
messing up, as in not helping make the world a better place. Luckily
there were also words of appreciation of my efforts in maintaining it.

Here's [the gory details].
