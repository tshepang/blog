Of all the (multiple) conversations the lead character has, my most
favorite is the one with the lady with red hair. Largely a
passive listener, he engages a lot more than usual, while also introspecting
self the most. One other scene I enjoyed is that involving a group of
four friends, who do a lot of negative talk, which is so deliberate it
feels rehearsed.

Most of the conversations are nonsensical,
which can be challenging to my patience.
It's an interesting movie, strange as it is.
It also has unusually good character animation.
