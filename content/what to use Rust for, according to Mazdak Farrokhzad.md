Farrokhzad is among the most active of Rust project members,
and that gives the following some weight:

> I do think Rust is, and should be, an excellent programming language
> for writing maintainable large scale concurrent high-performance &
> low-latency applications in particular. That is, Rust is great for
> writing a Firefox. Rust is also particularly suited for "symbolics"
> processing due to pattern matching, like e.g., OCaml and Haskell
> are. Whether Rust is the best language for application development
> seems like it would depend on the application. An application that
> doesn't have high-perf low-latency requirements seems like it might
> be well served by Idris.

As a sidenote, I do not agree... I is a fanboi.
