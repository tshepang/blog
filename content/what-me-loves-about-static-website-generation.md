There's a ridiculous amount of power and flexiblity in having all the
blog sources locally:

- One can use text editor of choice, which is a big help, given the
  quality of web-based editors in general.
- What this implies is that I can now put the blog in a [VCS]. This
  acts as some sort of backup too, since I place my sources on [a
  remote server].
- This also means that I can do a heck of a lot of edits without being
  connected to the web, or deeper changes like playing search-replace
  through the entire blog.

## cons

- The complexity of [the setup] is going to scare many people away.
- It can take a lot of time to setup; For me, this was made worse by
  having a lot of posts, as well as [being rather particular] about
  the look and functionality of the output.
