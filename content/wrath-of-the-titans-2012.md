The visual effects are decent, the performance of Liam Neeson (Zeus) a
lot better than in [the previous movie], the performance of Ralph
Fiennes a lot less menacing (and less interesting), and the movie itself
less exciting. The new character, the son of Poseidon, is interesting.
Andromeda, the queen of the human army, is given a miscast and
uninteresting performance by Rosamund Pike.
