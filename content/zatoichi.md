good:

-   The concept of a supreme fighter who also happens to be blind was a
    big draw for me. That, and the quality direction, makes for
    compelling viewing.
-   The lead performance is good, but I enjoyed it less that of Shintaro
    Katsu when he took the same role in [Zatoichi and the One-Armed
    Swordsman] (1971).

bad:

-   The geisha story received too much attention... it was done well
    and touching, but also mostly boring.
-   The crazy guy running around with a spear is too annoying.
-   The violence inflicted by the lead was too often excessive... he
    killed too easily.
